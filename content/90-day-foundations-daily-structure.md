## Daily Structure & Routines

All three cycles use the same daily structure. This consistency is what builds the habit and makes training sustainable.

## The Three Core Sessions

### 1. The 3PM Courtyard Session (10 Minutes) - THE ANCHOR

**This session is the foundation of everything. It happens EVERY SINGLE DAY, no matter what.**

**Structure:**

| Minutes | Activity | What You're Doing |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| 0-4 | **Marker Conditioning** | Random YES captures, 15-20 reps, high energy, rapid-fire |
| 4-10 | **Engagement Work** | Eye contact marking, green circle proximity, sit reps |

#### Marker Conditioning (0-4 minutes)

**Goal:** Build Pavlovian marker response. She hears "YES" and automatically orients to you.

**Protocol:**

- Watch for natural behaviors: glances at you, sniffs your hand, shifts weight toward you
- **Say "YES" the instant it happens**
- Hand to treat bag, drop treat to your side
- She comes to you for the treat
- Repeat 15-20 times in 4 minutes (rapid-fire, high energy)

**Key:** You're not asking for anything. You're catching good choices and marking them with YES.

#### Engagement Work (4-10 minutes)

**Goal:** Build active choice to check in with you, plus maintain known behaviors.

| What | How | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Eye contact marking | Wait for her to look at you, excited YES, reward | Building active choice to check in |
| Green circle proximity | Calm GOOD when she's in loose proximity, casual treat | Teaching position awareness |
| Sit reps (5-10) | Command once, mark when she sits, reward | Maintenance of known behavior |

**Key:** Sit reps are just maintenance. They should be easy. The real work is the marker conditioning and eye contact.

### Why This 10 Minutes Matters

- Builds bulletproof marker response
- Creates default handler focus
- Establishes daily training habit
- Takes only 10 minutes but compounds over 90 days
- If this is the ONLY thing you do on a busy day, it's enough

### 2. The Bonus Training Session (10-15 Minutes)

**This is where you teach the week's game.**

**Structure:**

| Minutes | Activity | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 0-2 | Warm-up | Quick marker reps, known behavior (get her engaged) |
| 2-12 | This week's game | Skill building |
| 12-15 | Cool-down | Calm GOOD markers, settle (end on success) |

#### Principles

- **Keep it short** - Brain work is exhausting
- **End on success** - Don't drill to failure
- **High value rewards** - This is skill-building, not maintenance
- **If she's struggling** - Make it easier (set her up to win)
- **Track progress** - You'll see it compound over weeks

#### Weekly Game Schedule

The bonus training session always focuses on that week's specific game. You'll find the detailed progression for each game in the cycle pages:

- **[Cycle 1: Building Confidence]({% link _pages/watermelon/90-day-foundations-cycle-1.md %})** - Details on each game
- **[Cycle 2: Emotional Regulation]({% link _pages/watermelon/90-day-foundations-cycle-2.md %})** - Details on each game
- **[Cycle 3: Impulse Control]({% link _pages/watermelon/90-day-foundations-cycle-3.md %})** - Details on each game

### 3. Check-Ins During Exercise (2-3 Per Walk)

**During walks and exercise, practice 2-3 check-in reps.**

| Step | Action | Marker/Reward |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Stop walking | - |
| 2 | Wait for eye contact (don't ask for it) | - |
| 3 | She looks at you | Excited YES |
| 4 | Reward | Treat or brief tug play |
| 5 | Release and continue walking | - |

**Bonus:** If she sees a trigger (dog/cat/squirrel) and checks in with you FIRST → JACKPOT (multiple treats or extended tug session)

---

## Meal Times: Practice Opportunities

### Breakfast & Dinner

Use meal times to practice Break (the release cue).

**Breakfast Setup:**

1. Prepare her food
2. Cue "place" on her bed (she lies down)
3. Place the bowl on the bed in front of her
4. Cue "break" when she can eat
5. She eats

**Dinner Setup:**

Same as breakfast, plus:

6. After she eats, practice Break again (she leaves the area)

---

## The Non-Negotiables (Every Single Day)

### ✅ Sessions

- 3pm Courtyard Session (10 min) - **THE ANCHOR - NEVER SKIP THIS**
- This week's game (10-15 min) - Based on current cycle
- Exercise outlet (walk/play/field) with 2-3 check-ins
- Multiple potty breaks
- Meals served appropriately
- Crate time maintained

### ✅ Practices Woven In

- Morning marker session (5 min)
- Break practice at meals (place bed)
- Check-ins during exercise
- Optional evening light work if energy allows

---

## Weekly Rhythm

### The Same Every Week

The daily schedule never changes. This consistency is powerful.

### What Changes Weekly

- The game you're teaching in the bonus session
- Your focus and what you're watching for
- Nothing else

This is beautiful. You don't have to decide daily what to do. You already know.

---

## Flexibility & Modifications

### What Stays Non-Negotiable

- **3pm Courtyard Session** - Every single day, all 10 minutes
- **Marker response** - Built into every session
- **Handler focus** - Always being developed

### What Can Flex

- **Bonus game timing** - Morning instead of afternoon is fine
- **Walk timing** - Early morning or evening works
- **Crate schedule** - Adjust around your work if needed
- **Optional evening session** - Skip if she's tired or you're overwhelmed

### During Disruptions (Travel, Sick Days, Etc.)

**Keep the 3pm Courtyard Session alive**

- Even if you're at your parents' house (Thanksgiving week example)
- Even if it's not exactly 3pm
- Even if it's shorter (7 minutes instead of 10)
- **This routine is your anchor.**

---

## Integration Points

### With Teaching Down

If you're also [teaching down](/watermelon/teaching-down/):

- Phase 1-5 practice happens during bonus session
- Phase 6 (duration) practice happens at meals
- Maintenance reps happen in courtyard session

### With Full Training Timeline

This 90-day program is weeks 1-5 of each cycle in the [150-day integrated timeline](/watermelon/training-timeline/). The daily structure remains identical throughout the entire arc.

## Weekly Reflection Template

### End of Each Week

#### Avoidant Goal Check (Preventing Problems)

| Question | Yes/No | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Did we avoid rehearsing bad patterns? | | |
| Did I keep her under threshold? | | |
| Did I manage high-arousal situations well? | | |
| Is she checking in MORE, not less? | | |
| Are recovery times from arousal getting faster? | | |

#### Aspirational Goal Check (Building Excellence)

| Question | Yes/No | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Did we make progress on this week's game? | | |
| Is her marker response getting faster? | | |
| Is her engagement improving? | | |
| Is she showing toy/tug drive? | | |
| Can she problem-solve without giving up? | | |

#### This Week's Wins

😊 **Handler Focus Wins:**
_(Times she chose you over environment)_

😊 **Drive Moments:**
_(Times she showed enthusiasm for training/play)_

😊 **Problem-Solving Wins:**
_(Times she figured something out)_

#### This Week's Challenges

😬 **What Needs Work:**
_(Areas where she struggled or regressed)_

#### Next Week's Focus

_(What to carry forward, what to adjust)_

## What Makes This Sustainable

1. **No Daily Decisions** - You know exactly what to do each day
2. **Only 10 Minutes Required** - The courtyard session is the minimum
3. **Flexible Timing** - Most activities can shift around your schedule
4. **Clear Progressions** - Each week's game is spelled out
5. **Built-in Reflection** - Weekly check-ins prevent overwhelm

## Common Questions

### "Can I do the 3pm session at a different time?"

Yes, but try to keep it consistent. The goal is building a habit. 3pm just happens to be when most people get home, but if another time works better, that's fine.

### "What if I miss a day?"

One missed day is fine. Two in a row, and you've lost the momentum. Try to keep the 3pm anchor daily, even if it's shorter.

### "Can I do longer sessions?"

Sure, but don't let it interfere with the 3pm anchor. That 10 minutes is sacred.

### "What if she's tired?"

- Shorten the session
- Make it just marker conditioning (4 minutes)
- Rest and try again tomorrow
- Training should be fun for her, not exhausting

### "Can I combine meals with training?"

Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Scatter feeding, meal-based training, all great ways to make training part of daily life.
