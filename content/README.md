# Melon's 150-Day Training Program

This is a complete, step-by-step training plan built for success. Not theory. Not inspiration. A practical, day-by-day roadmap that takes your dog from good to great over 150 days.

---

## The Promise

By the time you finish this program:
- Your dog has rock-solid impulse control and can regulate her own arousal
- She checks in with you as her default behavior
- She understands **down** as a foundation skill and holds it through distractions
- She's confident, problem-solving, and genuinely enjoys training
- You have a repeatable system that works

**This isn't luck. It's a plan that works when you work it.**

## Where to Start

### First 90 Days: The Foundation (Cycles 1-3)

- Three intensive 30-day cycles building confidence, emotional regulation, and impulse control
- 15 games you'll master, one cycle at a time

- 7 phases from introducing the lure to proofing through distractions
- How down becomes the basis for impulse control and settle work
- When you're ready for each phase (and when to repeat)

## One More Thing

Progress isn't linear. Some weeks are amazing. Some weeks are harder. Both are part of the journey. The magic isn't in being perfect—it's in showing up consistently.

**Start with [[90-day-foundations-hub|90-Day Foundations]] and take it one week at a time.**
