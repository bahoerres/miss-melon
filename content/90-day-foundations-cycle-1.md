## Key Training Principles

### Start Small
- First attempts should be easy
- Build from there
- Success breeds confidence

### Use High-Value Rewards
- Skill-building = best treats
- Maintenance = regular treats

### End on Success
- Don't drill to failure
- Stop the session while she's winning
- Leave her wanting more

### Problem-Solving Over Luring
- The games are designed to help her figure it out
- Don't always lure/hand-feed answers
- Let her think and problem-solve

### Environmental Management
- Keep early sessions in quiet, familiar places
- Gradually add complexity
- Don't overwhelm her

---

## Troubleshooting Cycle 1

### If She's Struggling with a Game

1. **Break it down smaller**
   - Middle: Start with just turning, not walking
   - Scent Trails: Start with 3-foot lines
   - Box Feeding: Just getting head in box, no duration yet

2. **Increase treat value**
   - Is the reward interesting enough?
   - Use her favorite treats

3. **Check your criteria**
   - Are you being consistent?
   - Is she clear what you're asking?

### If She's Flying Through Games

1. **Add difficulty**
   - Middle: Walk faster, longer distances, with distractions
   - Scent Trails: Longer trails, different surfaces
   - Box Feeding: More distractions, different boxes

2. **Don't skip weeks**
   - Keep to the timeline
   - Use extra time to generalize

### If She's Anxious or Stressed

- Back up to easier version
- Shorter sessions
- More frequent breaks
- Check if pain or physical issue is involved

## Weekly Reflection

At the end of each week (template from [[90-day-foundations-daily-structure|Daily Structure]]):

**What worked?**
**What was hard?**
**What will I adjust?**
**Where is her confidence?**
**Is handler focus improving?**

---

## Celebrating Cycle 1 Completion

When you run all 5 games in sequence successfully (Week 5), you've completed Cycle 1!

This is a MAJOR milestone. You have:

✅ Built handler focus as her default
✅ Established daily training routine
✅ Taught 5 foundational games
✅ Built problem-solving skills
✅ Proven you can train consistently

---

## Next: Cycle 2

Once Cycle 1 is complete, you're ready for **[[90-day-foundations-cycle-2|Cycle 2: Emotional Regulation]]**.

In Cycle 2, you'll teach arousal control, drive channeling, and start/stop switches. She'll learn to go from 100 to 0 in 30 seconds.
