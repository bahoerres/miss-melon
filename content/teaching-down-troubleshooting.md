## Troubleshooting - Common Problems & Solutions

---

## Phase 1-2: Introduce Lure & Build Speed

### Problem: She Won't Lie Down with the Lure

**Solutions:**

1. **Make sure lure goes ALL THE WAY to the ground**
   - Not hovering above it
   - Right on the surface she's on (carpet, grass, tile)

2. **Pull it slightly back toward her chest/under her**
   - Don't just go straight down
   - The L-shape motion (down, then back) is critical

3. **Try when she's already sitting**
   - Easier to down from a sit than from standing
   - Build confidence this way

4. **Use higher value treats**
   - What gets her excited?
   - Use the good stuff for learning the behavior

5. **Practice on a soft surface**
   - Carpet, grass, or yoga mat
   - Some dogs don't like hard floors (tile, concrete)

6. **Be patient**
   - First attempts can take 30+ seconds
   - Don't rush her
   - Let her figure it out

---

### Problem: She Stands Up and Walks Around the Lure

**Solutions:**

1. **Lure more slowly**
   - Don't rush
   - Give her time to process

2. **Start with her in a sit**
   - Easier to prevent backing up from a sit

3. **Practice with her back to a wall**
   - Can't back up or walk around
   - Limits her options

4. **Make sure treat is on the ground, not hovering**
   - Right on the surface
   - Not in the air

---

## Phase 3-4: Fade Lure & Add Verbal Cue

### Problem: She Gets Stuck in Phase 3 (Won't Down with Empty Hand)

**Solutions:**

1. **Go back to Phase 2 for 1-2 more days**
   - Build more reps with full lure
   - Create stronger muscle memory

2. **Make sure your empty-hand motion is EXACTLY the same as your lure motion**
   - Mirror image
   - Same speed, same distance
   - Record yourself to compare

3. **Start with intermittent mixing**
   - Do 3 reps with treat in hand
   - Do 1 rep with empty hand
   - Back to 3 reps with treat
   - Repeat cycle

4. **Be patient**
   - This is the hardest phase
   - Some dogs need 10-14 days here
   - That's completely normal

---

### Problem: She Only Responds to Hand Signal, Ignores Verbal Cue

**Solutions:**

1. **Make sure you're saying "down" BEFORE the hand signal**
   - Not at the same time
   - Not after
   - Verbal first, then hand signal 0.5 seconds later

2. **Increase the delay between verbal and hand signal**
   - Start with 0.5 seconds
   - Gradually increase to 1-2 seconds
   - This forces her to start responding to the word

3. **Do more reps in Phase 4 before moving to Phase 5**
   - Don't rush the pairing
   - She needs 30+ reps of hearing "down" paired with hand signal

4. **When testing verbal only, wait a full 3 seconds**
   - Before giving hand signal backup
   - Give her time to process

---

## Phase 5: Verbal Cue Only

### Problem: She's Not Responding to Verbal Cue Reliably

**Solutions:**

1. **Make sure she got enough practice pairing the cues in Phase 4**
   - Go back to Phase 4 for another week if needed
   - More reps = stronger association

2. **Increase the value of rewards for verbal-only success**
   - When she does it on the word alone, jackpot
   - Make it worth more than hand-signal tries

3. **Make sure you're waiting long enough**
   - Wait a full 3 seconds after saying "down"
   - Before giving hand signal backup

4. **Increase percentage of verbal-only trials more gradually**
   - Stick at 50% for a few extra days
   - Don't jump to 70% if she's only at 50% success

---

## Phase 6: Adding Duration

### Problem: She Breaks Position Constantly

**Solutions:**

1. **You're progressing too fast**
   - Go back to shorter durations
   - 2-4 seconds if she's breaking at 5 seconds

2. **Feed treats MORE often**
   - Every 3 seconds instead of 5-7
   - Keeps her engaged and in position

3. **Make sure you're using "GOOD" not "YES"**
   - "YES" makes her want to get up
   - "GOOD" tells her to keep staying

4. **Check that you're feeding treats IN position**
   - Between her paws, not making her move
   - She should barely move to get the treat

5. **Make sure the behavior itself is solid**
   - If she's not responding reliably to "down," duration will be hard
   - Go back to Phase 5 if needed

---

### Problem: She's Anxious/Stressed During Duration Work

**Signs of stress:**
- Yawning, lip licking, whale eye
- Panting excessively
- Trying to leave position repeatedly
- Whining or barking

**Solutions:**

1. **Shorten duration significantly**
   - Back to 5-10 seconds
   - Way below where she's comfortable

2. **Increase treat frequency**
   - Feed every 3 seconds (or even more often)
   - More frequent reward = less stress

3. **Remove all distractions**
   - Quiet room
   - Just you and her
   - Calm environment

4. **Practice in a place she's very comfortable**
   - Her favorite room
   - Familiar spot
   - Safe feeling

5. **Build confidence with easier exercises first**
   - Make sure the down position itself is comfortable
   - Some dogs find holding down stressful (pain, anxiety, posture)
   - Consult a trainer or vet if stress persists

---

### Problem: She Anticipates the Release

**What it looks like:**
- She pops up at exactly 20 seconds every time (because that's when you always release her)
- She starts shifting/preparing to get up before you release

**Solutions:**

1. **Variable duration**
   - Sometimes 10 sec, sometimes 30 sec, sometimes 45 sec
   - No predictable pattern

2. **Don't always go to max duration**
   - Mix short and long holds
   - Keeps her guessing

3. **Occasionally ask for very short durations mixed with long ones**
   - Just when she expects a long one

4. **Release is random, unpredictable**
   - She has to wait for your cue
   - Not clock-watching

---

### Problem: She'll Hold It For You But Not For Others

**Solutions:**

1. **Have other people practice with her**
   - Start with you nearby
   - Other person cues the behavior

2. **Other person cues behavior, you stand close and support**
   - Gradually fade your presence
   - She learns it applies to everyone

3. **Use the same hand signal and cue word**
   - Consistency across people

4. **She needs to learn "duration applies to everyone, not just dad"**
   - Takes more reps with multiple people
   - But it will generalize

---

## Phase 7: Distance & Distractions

### Problem: She Breaks When You Step Away

**Solutions:**

1. **You're going too far too fast**
   - Go back to 1 step away for another week
   - Build from there

2. **Make sure you're returning to reward her**
   - Don't toss treats from far away
   - Return and give her treats
   - Builds confidence that you're coming back

3. **Increase treat value**
   - More exciting rewards = more motivation to stay

4. **Start with her already in down**
   - Rather than cueing from standing
   - One less variable

---

### Problem: She Anticipates Your Return

**What it looks like:**
- She gets up right before you come back
- Has a predictable pattern

**Solutions:**

1. **Vary the time you're away**
   - Sometimes 5 sec, sometimes 15, sometimes 30
   - No predictable pattern

2. **Don't always return from the same direction**
   - Sometimes come back left, sometimes right
   - Mix it up

3. **Don't have a predictable routine**
   - Sometimes return immediately, sometimes wait longer
   - Sometimes make noise, sometimes be quiet

---

### Problem: She Can't Handle Real-World Distractions

**Solutions:**

1. **You're in too challenging an environment**
   - Start in quieter locations
   - Build up gradually

2. **Start in quieter locations**
   - Your living room
   - Backyard
   - Quiet park
   - Then gradually busier places

3. **Gradually expose her to busier environments**
   - One step up at a time
   - Don't jump from quiet room to busy cafe

4. **Keep sessions short in challenging locations**
   - 5-10 minutes max
   - Don't overwhelm her

5. **Increase treat value**
   - Make it worth her while
   - High-value treats for hard environments

---

### Problem: She's Stressed During Distance/Distraction Work

**Signs:** Panting, yawning, lip licking, whining

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce difficulty significantly**
   - Go back 2-3 levels
   - Build from there

2. **Increase treat frequency**
   - More rewards = more confidence

3. **Practice in calmer environments**
   - Familiar, quiet spaces
   - Build skills there first

4. **Make sure the behavior itself is fully solid**
   - Can she do 60-second down with you right next to her?
   - If not, don't add distance/distractions yet

---

## General Troubleshooting

### She's Regressing (Was Good, Now Not)

**Possible causes:**

1. **You've progressed too fast**
   - Back up one phase
   - Rebuild from there

2. **Life circumstances changed**
   - Travel, new family member, moved homes
   - Revert to practicing in familiar environment

3. **She's having a bad day**
   - Could be tired, distracted, or just off
   - Try again tomorrow

4. **Pain or discomfort**
   - Down is uncomfortable for some dogs
   - Consult a vet

---

### She's Inconsistent (Sometimes Works, Sometimes Doesn't)

**Solutions:**

1. **Inconsistency = not solid yet**
   - Not ready to progress
   - Do more reps at current level

2. **Increase reps**
   - 20-30+ reps per day
   - Build more repetitions

3. **Simplify the context**
   - Remove any extra challenges
   - Just the behavior you're working on

4. **Only progress when she's 8-9/10 successful**
   - Don't move forward too early

---

### You're Not Sure Which Phase to Go Back To

**Rule of thumb:**

Go back to the last phase where she was consistently successful 8-9/10 times, then rebuild from there.

## When to Seek Help

Consider working with a professional trainer if:

- She's showing signs of fear or anxiety during training
- You're stuck for more than 2 weeks at a phase
- The behavior is regressing significantly
- You're frustrated or unsure about what to do next
- There's any pain or physical discomfort involved
