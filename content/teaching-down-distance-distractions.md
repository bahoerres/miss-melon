## Phase 7: Add Distance & Bigger Distractions

**Timeline:** Weeks 9+ (2-4+ weeks)

**Goal:** She holds the down while you move away OR while bigger distractions occur (not both at once initially).

---

## When to Start Phase 7

**Only after duration is solid at 60+ seconds (Phase 6 complete).**

She should be holding down for 60+ seconds with mild distractions confidently and calmly.

---

## Critical Rule: Pick ONE at a Time

- Don't add distance AND distractions in the same session
- Master one, then add the other
- Once both are solid separately, you can combine them

---

## Path A: Adding Distance (Weeks 9-12+)

### Why Start with Distance First?

Distance is often easier than high distractions, so it's a good place to start building her confidence.

### Distance Progression

| Week | Distance Goal | Protocol |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Week 9** | 1-2 steps away | Cue down → take 1 step back → wait 5 sec → treat → release |
| **Week 10** | 3-5 steps away | Cue down → take 3 steps back → wait 10 sec → return and treat → release |
| **Week 11** | 10 steps away | Cue down → walk 10 steps → wait 15 sec → return and jackpot → release |
| **Week 12+** | Out of sight | Cue down → step around corner → wait 20 sec → return and jackpot → release |

### Week 9: 1-2 Steps Away

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Cue "down" | She downs | - |
| 2 | **Take 1 step back** | She holds | "GOOD" |
| 3 | **WAIT 5 seconds** | She holds | Toss treat to her (or step forward and give it) |
| 4 | **Take 1 step back again** | She holds | "GOOD" |
| 5 | **WAIT 5 seconds** | She holds | Toss treat |
| 6 | **Step back to her** | She holds | Treat |
| 7 | Release | She gets up | - |

### Week 10: 3-5 Steps Away

- Same protocol as Week 9, but take 3-5 steps back instead of 1
- Always return to her to give treats (builds confidence)
- Wait 10 seconds while you're away

### Week 11: 10 Steps Away

- Cue down
- Walk 10 steps away
- Wait 15 seconds
- Return and jackpot (3-4 treats)
- Release

### Week 12+: Out of Sight

- Cue down
- Step around a corner
- She can't see you (just for a few seconds at first)
- Wait 20 seconds
- Return and jackpot
- Release

### Key Points for Distance Work

**Always Return to Reward:**

- If you're working on distance, step back to her to give treats
- OR toss treats to her (but this can encourage her to break position to get them)
- Returning builds confidence: she learns "you'll come back"

**Jackpot for Hard Stuff:**

- When she holds through distance = 3-4 treats in a row
- When she holds while you're out of sight = jackpot
- Big challenges = big rewards

**If She Breaks:**

- Make it easier: less distance, shorter duration
- Only progress when she's succeeding 8/10 times at current level

---

## Path B: Adding Bigger Distractions (Weeks 9-12+)

### Distraction Progression

| Week | Distraction Level | Examples |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| **Week 9** | Moderate | You walk fully around her, clap hands, drop objects |
| **Week 10** | High | Another person walks by, doorbell rings, toy on ground nearby |
| **Week 11** | Very High | Another dog visible at distance, food on ground, kids playing nearby |
| **Week 12+** | Real-world | Practice in public (parks, cafes, busy sidewalks) |

### Week 9: Moderate Distractions

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Cue "down" | She downs | - |
| 2 | **Introduce distraction** (walk around her) | She holds | "GOOD" + treat immediately |
| 3 | **Remove distraction, wait 5 seconds** | She holds | "GOOD" |
| 4 | **Introduce distraction again** (drop object) | She holds | "GOOD" + treat |
| 5 | **Wait 5 seconds** | She holds | "GOOD" |
| 6 | Release | She gets up | - |

### Week 10: High Distractions

- Add person walking by
- Ring doorbell
- Place toy on ground nearby
- Same protocol: introduce distraction → she holds → immediate reward

### Week 11: Very High Distractions

- Another dog visible at distance
- Food on ground nearby
- Kids playing
- Increase distance of dog/food to keep her threshold manageable

### Week 12+: Real-World Practice

- Take her to busier environments
- Park with other dogs around
- Cafe with people walking by
- Maintain the same reward structure

### Key Points for Distraction Work

**Reward DURING/AFTER Distractions:**

- Always reward immediately after she holds through a distraction
- This teaches "big distractions = big rewards"

**Start with Just One Distraction:**

- Don't introduce person + dog + food all at once
- One thing at a time
- Layer them once each is solid

**If She Breaks:**

- The distraction was too hard
- Go back to easier distractions
- Build up more gradually
- Make sure treats are even more valuable

---

## Combining Distance + Distractions (Week 13+)

Once both are solid separately, you can start combining them:

### Example Combined Challenge

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Cue "down" | She downs | - |
| 2 | Walk 5 steps away | She holds | "GOOD" from distance |
| 3 | Another person walks past (distraction) | She holds | "GOOD" |
| 4 | Wait 10 seconds | She holds | Walk back, give treat |
| 5 | Walk away again, this time 10 steps | She holds | "GOOD" from distance |
| 6 | Wait 20 seconds | She holds | Walk back, jackpot (3-4 treats) |
| 7 | Release | She gets up | - |

**Total:** 60+ second down with distance + distraction combined.

## Real-World Testing

### Where to Practice

| Location | Challenge Level | What You're Testing |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Quiet room** | Very Easy | Baseline (should be solid) |
| **Living room with family** | Easy | Mild distractions, familiar environment |
| **Backyard with neighbor** | Medium | New person, mild distractions |
| **Local park** | Hard | Dogs, people, exciting smells |
| **Cafe patio** | Very Hard | Lots of people, smells, movement |

### Testing Protocol

1. Cue "down"
2. Let her hold for 30-60 seconds
3. Add appropriate distraction for that location
4. Reward heavily for success
5. If she struggles, go back to easier locations

---

## Troubleshooting Phase 7

### Problem: She Breaks When You Step Away

**Solutions:**
- You're going too far too fast
- Go back to 1 step away for another week
- Make sure you're returning to reward her
- Increase treat value

### Problem: She Anticipates Your Return

**What it looks like:** She gets up right before you come back

**Solutions:**
- Vary the time you're away (sometimes 5 sec, sometimes 15, sometimes 30)
- Don't always return from the same direction
- Don't have a predictable pattern

### Problem: She Can't Handle Real-World Distractions

**Solutions:**
- You're in too challenging an environment
- Start in quieter locations
- Gradually expose her to busier environments
- Keep sessions short in challenging locations (5-10 minutes max)
- Increase treat value

### Problem: She's Stressed During Distance/Distraction Work

**Signs:** Panting, yawning, lip licking, whining

**Solutions:**
- Reduce difficulty significantly
- Increase treat frequency
- Practice in calmer environments
- Make sure the behavior itself is fully solid first

✅ She holds down while you're out of sight (even briefly)
✅ She holds through high-level distractions (people walking by, other dogs at distance)
✅ She can combine distance + distractions (you're far away AND things are happening)
✅ She works reliably in real-world locations
✅ She's calm and confident (not stressed)
