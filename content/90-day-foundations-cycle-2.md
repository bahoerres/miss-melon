## Cycle 2: Emotional Regulation & Arousal Control

**Duration:** December 21, 2025 - January 20, 2026 (30 days)

**Goal:** By January 20th, Melon can regulate her arousal - go from high-energy play to calm settle within 30 seconds. She plays with rules, has start and stop switches, and channels excitement toward you.

**Outcome:** Arousal control, drive + boundaries, post-arousal reset skills.

---

## The 5 Games

### 1. Red Light, Green Light (Week 1)
**What:** Start/stop arousal control - stop running on cue, settle quickly
**Why:** Teaches impulse control, arousal regulation, switching gears fast
**Week 1 Goal:** Goes from high-energy play to calm in under 30 seconds

### 2. Tug With Rules (Week 2)
**What:** Drive + boundaries - play intensely, drop on cue, wait for permission to re-engage
**Why:** Channels drive, teaches drop behavior, maintains relationship during arousal
**Week 2 Goal:** Plays enthusiastically and drops on first cue even when aroused

### 3. Knock Over Water Bottle (Week 3)
**What:** Frustration tolerance - push/knock objects, doesn't give up when it's hard
**Why:** Teaches persistence without frustration, channels energy productively
**Week 3 Goal:** Knocks over reliably and doesn't give up when harder

### 4. Herding Step 1 (Week 4)
**What:** Physical boundaries - respects a line even with temptation
**Why:** Teaches self-control, boundary respect, impulse control
**Week 4 Goal:** Respects physical boundary with temptation present

### 5. Scatter Feeding (Week 4)
**What:** Post-arousal reset - calm nose work after high arousal
**Why:** Shifts brain from arousal to nose work, teaches settling
**Week 4 Goal:** Immediately shifts to calm after high-arousal play

## Week 5: Integration & Assessment (Jan 18-20)

### Goal
Run all 5 Cycle 2 games in sequence and assess arousal control progress.

### Assessment: Arousal Regulation Test

Test how she handles arousal spike → stop:

1. **High-energy play** (tug, Red Light/Green Light)
2. **Immediate stop**
3. **Scatter feed or calm settle**
4. **Measure recovery time to baseline**

### Reflection Questions

- Can she go from 100 to 0 in under 30 seconds?
- Does she drop toy on first cue when aroused?
- Can she work through frustration without giving up?
- Is her excitement directed toward you or away?

### Outcome

Ready for Cycle 3 or need more work on arousal control?

## Key Principles for Cycle 2

### Arousal is Information
- Arousal itself isn't bad
- Teaching her to channel it is the goal
- She needs to learn "excitement = check in with me"

### Start Below Threshold
- Build the behavior in calm first
- Then add arousal gradually
- Don't start with max arousal

### Reward the Regulate, Not the Arousal
- Don't reward for being aroused
- Reward for going from aroused to calm
- Reward for making the right choice when excited

### Real-World Application
- These games translate to:
  - Seeing other dogs and checking in first
  - Settling when you need her to
  - Channeling excitement toward training
  - Managing her own emotions

---

## Troubleshooting Cycle 2

### If She Can't Stop on Cue
- She's probably not aroused enough yet
- Make sure the game is genuinely exciting
- Build stop behavior in calm first

### If She Gets More Aroused, Not Less
- Back off on duration/intensity
- Make the stop cue clearer
- Increase reward for the stop

### If Frustration Leads to Avoidance
- The task might be too hard
- Break it into smaller steps
- She should be challenged, not overwhelmed

## Celebrating Cycle 2 Completion

When all 5 games are complete and she's regulating arousal reliably, you've completed Cycle 2!

You now have:

✅ Arousal regulation skills
✅ Drive channeling toward handler
✅ Clear start/stop switches
✅ Post-arousal reset ability
✅ Foundation for advanced work
