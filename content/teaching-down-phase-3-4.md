## Phase 3-4: Fade Lure & Add Verbal Cue

**Timeline:** Days 9-20 (12 days total)

**Goal:** Transition from lure-dependent to responding to your hand signal and verbal cue. She starts anticipating the down before you complete the motion.

---

## Why Phase 3 Is the Hardest

This is where most people get stuck. You're transitioning from a visible treat (the lure) to just your hand motion. We'll break it into 3 sub-phases to make it systematic and achievable.

**Key principle:** Many people don't fade systematically. We'll break it down step by step.

---

## Phase 3A: Smaller Lure Motion (Days 9-11)

### What You're Doing

- Still have treat in hand, but make the motion smaller and faster
- Instead of slowly lowering treat all the way to ground, you drop your hand halfway and she should anticipate the rest

### Training Protocol

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Treat in fist, start at her nose level | Watching your hand | - |
| 2 | Drop hand HALFWAY to ground (not all the way) | She starts to lower | - |
| 3 | Stop your hand motion | She completes the down on her own | "YES" the instant elbows hit |
| 4 | Bring treat down to her and give it | She's in full down | Feed 2-3 treats |
| 5 | Release | She gets up | - |

### Success Metric

She anticipates the down and completes it even though your hand didn't go all the way to the ground.

### Reps & Frequency

- 15-20 reps per session
- 2 sessions per day
- 2-3 days at this level before moving to Phase 3B

---

## Phase 3B: Empty Hand Motion (Days 12-14)

### What You're Doing

- Treat is in your OTHER hand (behind your back or in your pocket)
- Your lure hand is EMPTY but makes the same motion
- She downs, THEN you produce the treat from the other hand

### This Is the Critical Step

She's now responding to the MOTION, not the treat. The treat appears AFTER the behavior.

### Training Protocol

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Empty fist in front of her nose (treat in other hand) | Sniffs empty hand | - |
| 2 | Drop empty hand halfway to ground | She follows the motion and downs | "YES" when elbows hit |
| 3 | Immediately grab treat from other hand | She holds down | Give treat between her paws |
| 4 | Release | She gets up | - |

### If She Doesn't Down with Empty Hand

- Go back to Phase 3A for another day
- Make sure your hand motion is EXACTLY the same as when you had the treat
- Be patient - this is a big leap for her brain

### Reps & Frequency

- 15-20 reps per session
- 2-3 sessions per day
- 2-3 days at this level before moving to Phase 3C

---

## Phase 3C: Subtle Hand Signal (Day 15)

### What You're Doing

- Your hand motion gets even smaller
- Eventually it's just a small downward point or finger motion
- Treat still comes from other hand after the behavior

### Training Protocol

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Small downward motion (just a few inches) | She downs immediately | "YES" |
| 2 | Treat from other hand | She holds down | Give treat |
| 3 | Release | She gets up | - |

### Goal

Your hand signal is now a subtle cue, not a big lure motion.

### Reps & Frequency

- 10-15 reps per session
- 2 sessions per day

### Success Metric for Phase 3

By end of Phase 3, she downs reliably **(9/10 times)** when you make a small hand motion, with no treat visible in that hand.

---

## Phase 4: Add Verbal Cue (Days 16-20)

### Goal

Pair the word "down" with the hand signal so she starts to learn the verbal cue.

### Critical Rule: Verbal First, Then Hand Signal

**VERBAL CUE COMES FIRST, THEN HAND SIGNAL.**

If you do hand signal first, she'll always rely on the visual and ignore the word.

### Training Protocol

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Say "DOWN" | She might look at you, might not move | - |
| 2 | **Immediately** (within 0.5 seconds) give hand signal | She downs | "YES" when elbows hit |
| 3 | Treat from other hand | She holds down | Give treat |
| 4 | Release | She gets up | - |

### Timing Is Everything

- Say "down"
- Count "one-thousand-one"
- Give hand signal
- She downs

### What to Watch For

After 20-30 reps: She'll start to anticipate. When you say "down," she'll begin moving BEFORE you give the hand signal. That's exactly what you want.

### Reps & Frequency

- 15-20 reps per session
- 2-3 sessions per day
- 4-5 days at this level

### Success Metric for Phase 4

By end of Phase 4, she **starts moving into a down when she hears "down,"** before you give the hand signal (at least 5 out of 10 times).

## Progress Checklist

- [ ] Phase 3A complete: Downs with halfway hand motion 8/10 times
- [ ] Phase 3B complete: Downs with empty hand motion 8/10 times
- [ ] Phase 3C complete: Downs with subtle hand signal 9/10 times
- [ ] Phase 4 complete: Anticipates verbal cue 5+/10 times before you give hand signal
- [ ] Ready to move to [[teaching-down-phase-5|Phase 5: Verbal Cue Only]]

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not fading systematically** - Don't jump from full lure to empty hand. Use Phase 3A as the bridge.
2. **Moving too fast** - Stay at each sub-phase for 2-3 days. Speed comes from repetition.
3. **Inconsistent hand motion** - Make sure your empty-hand motion looks identical to your lure motion.
4. **Verbal cue timing** - Say "down" BEFORE the hand signal, not simultaneously.

## Next Steps

Once she's responding to "down" before you give the hand signal (Phase 4 complete), move on to **[[teaching-down-phase-5|Phase 5: Verbal Cue Only]]**. She's almost there!
