## Teaching Down - Your Complete Training Hub

The down command is one of the most important foundation skills you'll teach. It's the basis for impulse control, settle work, distance training, and advanced obedience. This guide breaks down the complete journey from introducing the lure to proofing the behavior in real-world situations.

---

## Quick Overview

**What is "Down"?** A cue that tells your dog to lie down on the ground (belly, elbows, and hips all making contact with the floor) and hold that position until released.

**Why it matters:**
- Foundation for impulse control (down is naturally calming)
- Essential for advanced work (down-stays, distance work, place training)
- Real-world utility (settles in public, during vet visits, at home)
- Building block for send-to-spot, down-in-motion, and more

**Training timeline:** 6-10 weeks to a rock-solid down with duration and distraction-proofing.

## The 7 Phases at a Glance

| Phase | Goal | Timeline |
|-------|------|----------|
| **[[teaching-down-phase-1-2\|Phase 1-2: Introduce & Build Speed]]** | Get the behavior with a lure, build reliability | 1-8 days |
| **[[teaching-down-phase-3-4\|Phase 3-4: Fade Lure & Add Verbal]]** | Transition to hand signal and verbal cue | 9-20 days |
| **[[teaching-down-phase-5\|Phase 5: Verbal Cue Only]]** | She responds to "down" with no hand signal | 21-27 days |
| **[[teaching-down-duration\|Phase 6: Add Duration]]** | She holds the down for 2-60+ seconds | 4 weeks |
| **[[teaching-down-distance-distractions\|Phase 7: Distance & Distractions]]** | She holds while you move away or distractions occur | 2-4+ weeks |

## Getting Started

### Before You Begin:

- Have high-value treats ready (small, soft, smelly)
- Choose a quiet location (living room, courtyard)
- Plan for 10-15 reps per session, 2-3 sessions per day
- Be consistent with your criteria (full down = elbows + belly + hips all down)

### Key Success Tips:

✅ **Be patient with Phase 3** - Fading the lure is the hardest part, but you'll get through it
✅ **Use calm "GOOD" not excited "YES"** during duration work
✅ **Feed treats between her paws** to keep her in position
✅ **Don't rush to phases** - Only move forward when she's succeeding 8/10 times

## Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### [[teaching-down-phase-1-2|Phase 1-2: Introduce Lure & Build Speed (Days 1-8)]]
Get the behavior using a lure, then build speed and reliability. By the end, she's dropping into a down within 3 seconds.

### [[teaching-down-phase-3-4|Phase 3-4: Fade Lure & Add Verbal Cue (Days 9-20)]]
The hardest part - transition from lure-dependent to responding to your hand signal and verbal cue. She starts anticipating the down before you complete the motion.

### [[teaching-down-phase-5|Phase 5: Verbal Cue Only (Days 21-27)]]
She responds to "down" with no hand signal needed. Hand signal becomes backup/optional. She's starting to reliably respond to the verbal cue alone.

### [[teaching-down-duration|Phase 6: Add Duration (Weeks 5-8)]]
She holds the down position for extended periods (2 seconds → 10 seconds → 30 seconds → 60+ seconds). This is where real-world utility starts.

### [[teaching-down-distance-distractions|Phase 7: Distance & Distractions (Weeks 9+)]]
She holds the down while you move away OR while bigger distractions occur. Eventually combines both: down while you're out of sight with other dogs nearby.

## What Success Looks Like

By the time you're done with all 7 phases, your dog will:

✅ Drop into down within 2 seconds of hearing "down" (verbal only)
✅ Work from any starting position (sitting, standing, walking)
✅ Work in different locations (apartment, courtyard, parents' house, public)
✅ Hold the down for 60+ seconds
✅ Hold while you're 10+ steps away or out of sight
✅ Hold through moderate to high distractions
✅ Be calm and relaxed during down work (not stressed)

## Where Down Fits In Your Training

- **90-Day Foundations Program:** Down is the foundation skill taught alongside Break during weeks 1-5, then built into duration work during weeks 6-9
- **Full Integrated Timeline:** Down progression is woven throughout the entire 150-day training arc
- **Cycle Integration:** Down duration is practiced during every bonus session and becomes maintenance-only after week 15

## Integration Into Daily Routine

Practice down in these contexts throughout your day:

| Context | When | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Bonus Training Session** | Afternoon (3:45pm) | Current phase you're in |
| **Courtyard Session** | 3pm (end) | Quick maintenance |
| **Before Meals** | Breakfast & dinner | Test/maintenance |
| **Meal Prep** | While preparing food | Duration practice |
| **Settle Time** | Evening | Duration practice |
| **Random Throughout Day** | Whenever | Generalization |

**Total daily reps:** 20-30+ (plenty to progress through phases)
