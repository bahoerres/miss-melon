## Phase 5: Verbal Cue Only

**Timeline:** Days 21-27 (7 days total)

**Goal:** She responds to "down" with no hand signal needed. Hand signal becomes backup/optional.

---

## What Phase 5 Means

By now, she's hearing "down" and starting to anticipate the behavior before you give your hand signal. Phase 5 is about testing and building confidence in the verbal cue until it's rock-solid.

---

## Phase 5A: Test the Verbal Cue (Days 21-23)

### What You're Doing

- You're testing whether she'll respond to JUST the word "down"
- Mixing in some trials where you give the hand signal as backup
- This builds reliability gradually

### Training Protocol

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Say "DOWN" | **WAIT 2-3 seconds** | - |
| 2 | Does she down? | **YES:** She downs on verbal only | "YES" + jackpot (3-4 treats) |
| 2b | Does she down? | **NO:** She doesn't move | Give hand signal as backup |
| 3 | Release | She gets up | - |

### The Test Ratio

Mix up your trials:

- **50% of reps:** Verbal only, wait to see if she does it
- **50% of reps:** Verbal + immediate hand signal (to keep reinforcing the pairing)

### Important Note

When she DOESN'T respond to just the verbal cue, give the hand signal as backup. Don't get frustrated - she's still learning.

### Reps & Frequency

- 10-15 reps per session
- 2 sessions per day
- 3 days at this level

### Success Metric for Phase 5A

She responds to "down" (verbal only) at least 5-6 out of 10 times during the test trials.

---

## Phase 5B: Increase Verbal-Only Success Rate (Days 24-27)

### What You're Doing

As she gets better, you're gradually increasing the percentage of verbal-only trials (without the hand signal backup).

### Progression by Day

- **Day 24:** 60% verbal only
- **Day 25:** 70% verbal only
- **Day 26:** 80% verbal only
- **Day 27:** 90% verbal only

### Training Protocol (Same as Phase 5A)

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Say "DOWN" | **WAIT 2-3 seconds** | - |
| 2 | Does she down? | **YES:** She downs on verbal only | "YES" + jackpot (3-4 treats) |
| 2b | Does she down? | **NO:** She doesn't move | Give hand signal as backup |
| 3 | Release | She gets up | - |

### If She's Not Responding Consistently

- Wait 3 seconds
- Give hand signal as backup
- Don't punish or get frustrated - just mark and reward the down
- Try again next rep
- This might mean she needs more time at the previous percentage

### Reps & Frequency

- 10-15 reps per session
- 2 sessions per day
- 4 days at this level

### Success Metric for Phase 5B

By end of Phase 5, she responds to "down" (verbal only) **8-9 out of 10 times**, with no hand signal needed.

## Important Notes

### Don't Skip to the Next Phase Too Early

Only move to [[teaching-down-duration|Phase 6: Add Duration]] once she's reliably responding to verbal "down" 8-9/10 times.

Duration work requires a solid foundation. If the verbal cue isn't solid, duration training will be much harder.

### The Hand Signal Doesn't Go Away

Even once she's verbal-only, you can still use the hand signal as backup if needed. It's there for you.

### Patience Is Key

Some dogs get this in 7 days. Some need 10-14 days. That's totally normal.

## Progress Checklist

- [ ] Phase 5A complete: Responds to verbal "down" 5-6/10 times
- [ ] Day 24: 60% verbal-only trials succeeding
- [ ] Day 25: 70% verbal-only trials succeeding
- [ ] Day 26: 80% verbal-only trials succeeding
- [ ] Day 27: 90% verbal-only trials succeeding
- [ ] Phase 5 complete: Responds to "down" (verbal only) 8-9/10 times
- [ ] Ready to move to [[teaching-down-duration|Phase 6: Add Duration]]

---

## Next Steps

Once she's responding reliably to the verbal "down" cue (8-9/10 times), you're ready for **[[teaching-down-duration|Phase 6: Add Duration]]**.  This is where the behavior becomes truly useful in real-world situations.
