## THE NON-NEGOTIABLE: 3PM COURTYARD SESSION

This session happens **every single day, no matter what.** This is your foundation anchor.

### Structure (10 minutes total):

|**Minutes**|**Activity**|**What You're Doing**|
|---|---|---|
|0:00 - 4:00|**Marker Conditioning**|Random YES captures, 15-20 reps, high energy, rapid-fire|
|4:00 - 10:00|**Engagement Work**|Eye contact marking (excited YES), green circle proximity (calm GOOD), sit reps|

### Why This Matters:

- Builds bulletproof marker response
- Creates default handler focus
- Establishes daily training habit
- Takes 10 minutes but compounds over 90 days

---

## TRAINING SESSIONS: DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### 3PM Courtyard Session (Every Day, All Cycles)

#### Minutes 0-4: Marker Conditioning

|**What**|**How**|**Why**|
|---|---|---|
|Random YES captures|Say YES when she glances at you, sniffs your hand, shifts weight toward you|Building Pavlovian marker response|
|High rate of reinforcement|15-20 reps in 4 minutes|Creating automatic orient-to-handler|
|Excited delivery|Hand to treat bag, drop treat to your side, she comes to you|Building drive toward handler|

### Minutes 4-10: Engagement Work

|**What**|**How**|**Why**|
|---|---|---|
|Eye contact marking|Wait for her to look at you, excited YES, reward|Building active choice to check in|
|Green circle proximity|Calm GOOD when she's in loose proximity, casual treat|Teaching position awareness|
|Sit reps (5-10)|Command once, mark when she sits, reward|Maintenance of known behavior|

---

## Bonus Training Session Structure

### Format (10-15 minutes):

|**Minutes**|**Activity**|**Purpose**|

|0-2|Warm-up (quick marker reps, known behavior)|Get her engaged and thinking|
|2-12|This week's game progression|Skill building|
|12-15|Cool-down (calm GOOD markers, settle)|End on success, transition to calm|

### Principles:

- Keep it short (brain work is exhausting)
- End on success (don't drill to failure)
- High value rewards (this is skill-building, not maintenance)
- If she's struggling, make it easier (set her up to win)

## Walk Integration: Check-Ins

### During Walks (2-3 times per walk):

|**Step**|**Action**|**Marker/Reward**|

|2|Wait for eye contact (don't ask for it)|-|
|3|She looks at you|Excited YES|
|4|Reward|Treat or brief tug play|
|5|Release and continue walking|-|

**Bonus:** If she sees a trigger (dog/cat/squirrel) and checks in with you FIRST → JACKPOT (multiple treats or extended tug session)
