title: Adding Duration to Any Behavior - Universal Protocol
layout: post
---

## OVERVIEW

### What Duration Means:

The dog holds a position (down, sit, place, stand) until released, even as time passes, you move around, or distractions occur.

### Why Duration Matters:

- **Impulse control foundation:** Holding a position despite wanting to move = self-control
- **Real-world utility:** Settling in public, waiting at doors, staying while you cook dinner
- **Building block for advanced work:** Distance work, out-of-sight stays, place training under distractions
- **Emotional regulation:** Duration work is inherently calming

### What Skills It Builds:

- Patience and frustration tolerance
- Ability to hold arousal/excitement in check
- Handler focus over extended periods
- Confidence (dog learns "I can do hard things")

---

## THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF DURATION

Duration isn't just "how long can she hold it." There are three variables:

|**Dimension**|**What It Means**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Time**|How long she holds the position|2 seconds → 2 minutes → 10 minutes|
|**Distance**|How far away you are|Right next to her → 10 feet away → out of sight|
|**Distraction**|What's happening around her|Quiet room → you moving around → other dogs present|

**The Rule:** Only increase ONE dimension at a time.

**Bad:** Ask for 30-second down while you walk 10 feet away in a busy park (time + distance + distraction all at once)

**Good:** Ask for 30-second down while you stand right next to her in a quiet room (just time)

---

## PREREQUISITE: BEHAVIOR MUST BE SOLID FIRST

Before adding duration, the behavior itself must be:

- ✅ Reliable (she does it 9/10 times on first cue)
- ✅ Fast (responds within 2-3 seconds)
- ✅ On verbal cue (not dependent on lures/hand signals)

**If the behavior isn't solid yet, don't add duration.** Finish teaching the behavior first, then come back to this protocol.

---

## THE DURATION PROGRESSION: 4 PHASES

|**Phase**|**Focus**|**Timeline**|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|Time only (2-10 seconds)|Week 1|
|**2**|Time extended (10-30 seconds)|Week 2|
|**3**|Time + mild distractions (30-60 seconds)|Week 3|
|**4**|Time + distance OR distractions (60+ seconds)|Week 4+|

---

## PHASE 1: TIME ONLY (2-10 SECONDS) - WEEK 1

### **Goal:**

Dog holds position for 2-10 seconds while you stand still right next to them.

### **Setup:**

- Quiet location (apartment, courtyard)
- No distractions
- You're standing/sitting right next to her
- 10-15 reps per session, 2 sessions per day

---

### **Training Protocol:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue the behavior ("down", "place", "sit")|She does the behavior|-|
|2|**WAIT 2 seconds** (count: one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two)|She holds position|"GOOD" (calm marker)|
|3|Feed treat in position (between paws for down, on the bed for place)|She stays in position|-|
|4|**WAIT 2 more seconds**|She holds|"GOOD"|
|5|Feed another treat|She stays|-|
|6|Release ("break")|She gets up|-|

**Total duration:** 4 seconds (2 sec + treat + 2 sec + treat + release)

---

### **Progression Through Week 1:**

|**Day**|**Duration Goal**|**Protocol**|
|---|---|---|
|**1-2**|2-4 seconds|Wait 2 sec → treat → wait 2 sec → treat → release|
|**3-4**|4-6 seconds|Wait 2 sec → treat → wait 2 sec → treat → wait 2 sec → treat → release|
|**5-6**|6-10 seconds|Wait 3 sec → treat → wait 3 sec → treat → wait 3 sec → treat → release|
|**7**|Test 10 seconds|Wait full 10 seconds, treat at 3, 6, 9 seconds, release at 10|

---

### **Key Points:**

**Use "GOOD" not "YES":**

- "YES" is an excited marker that makes her want to pop up and come to you
- "GOOD" is a calm marker that means "keep doing what you're doing, more is coming"
- Reserve "YES" for when you're RELEASING her from the position

**Feed Treats IN POSITION:**

- For down: Between her front paws (not above her head - that makes her sit up)
- For place: Drop treat onto the bed where she's lying
- For sit: At her nose level while she's sitting
- Goal: She learns "staying here = treats keep coming"

**Start Small:**

- 2 seconds feels ridiculously short, but it's building the foundation
- If you start with 10 seconds right away, she'll break position and learn that's okay
- Build gradually so she succeeds at every step

**If She Breaks Position:**

- Don't reward
- Reset and try again with SHORTER duration (make it easier)
- Only increase duration when she's succeeding 8/10 times at current level

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Week 1, she holds position for 10 seconds with 2-3 treat deliveries, 8 out of 10 times.

---

## PHASE 2: EXTENDED TIME (10-30 SECONDS) - WEEK 2

### **Goal:**

Dog holds position for 10-30 seconds. You're still right next to her, no distractions.

### Setup:

- Same as Phase 1 (quiet location, you're close)
- 10-15 reps per session, 2 sessions per day

---

### Training Protocol:

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue behavior|She does it|-|
|2|**WAIT 5 seconds**|She holds|"GOOD" at 3 seconds (verbal only, no treat yet)|
|3|Feed treat in position|She stays|-|
|4|**WAIT 5 more seconds**|She holds|"GOOD" at 3 seconds|
|5|Feed treat|She stays|-|
|6|**WAIT 5 more seconds**|She holds|"GOOD"|
|7|Feed treat|She stays|-|
|8|Release ("break")|She gets up|-|

**Total duration:** ~15 seconds

---

### Progression Through Week 2:

|**Day**|**Duration Goal**|**How Many Treats**|
|---|---|---|
|**1-2**|10-15 seconds|2-3 treats|
|**3-4**|15-20 seconds|3-4 treats|
|**5-6**|20-25 seconds|3-4 treats|
|**7**|25-30 seconds|4-5 treats|

---

### Key Points:

**Reduce Treat Frequency:**

- Week 1: Treat every 2-3 seconds
- Week 2: Treat every 5-7 seconds
- She's learning to hold longer between rewards

**Use Verbal "GOOD" Between Treats:**

- Say "good" calmly every few seconds even when you're not giving a treat
- This keeps her engaged and reassures her she's doing the right thing
- Helps bridge the gap between treats

**Variable Duration:**

- Don't always go to the max duration
- Mix it up: sometimes release at 10 seconds, sometimes 20, sometimes 30
- This prevents her from anticipating the release at a specific time

**If She Gets Wiggly:**

- She's not ready for that duration yet
- Go back to shorter durations for another day
- Make sure you're feeding enough treats to keep her motivated

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Week 2, she holds position for 30 seconds with 4-5 treat deliveries, 8 out of 10 times.

---

## PHASE 3: TIME + MILD DISTRACTIONS (30-60 SECONDS) - WEEK 3

### Goal:

Dog holds position for 30-60 seconds while mild distractions occur. You're still close to her.

### Setup:

- Same quiet location
- Now you add mild movement/distractions
- 10-15 reps per session, 2 sessions per day

---

### Mild Distractions to Add:

|**Day**|**Distraction**|**What You Do**|
|---|---|---|
|**1-2**|Your movement|Shift weight, scratch your head, look around|
|**3-4**|Small steps|Take 1-2 steps side to side (not away)|
|**5-6**|Hand movements|Wave your arms, clap softly, gesture|
|**7**|Combination|Move, gesture, shift - multiple mild distractions|

---

### Training Protocol:

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue behavior|She does it|-|
|2|**WAIT 5 seconds, then add distraction** (shift weight, take small step)|She holds despite distraction|"GOOD" + treat immediately|
|3|**WAIT 5 seconds, neutral**|She holds|"GOOD"|
|4|**Add distraction** (wave arm)|She holds|"GOOD" + treat|
|5|**WAIT 5 seconds**|She holds|"GOOD"|
|6|**Add distraction**|She holds|"GOOD" + treat|
|7|Release ("break")|She gets up|-|

**Total duration:** 30+ seconds with 3-4 distractions

---

### Key Points:

**Reward DURING/AFTER Distractions:**

- If she holds position while you move = immediate treat
- This teaches "when distractions happen, holding position = big reward"

**Keep Distractions Mild:**

- Week 3 is NOT the time for big movements, loud noises, or other dogs
- You're just adding small things: your movement, gestures, shifting
- Goal: She learns to hold position even when things aren't perfectly still

**If She Breaks During Distraction:**

- The distraction was too hard
- Go back to easier distractions (just shifting weight)
- Build up more gradually

**Start Reducing Treat Frequency:**

- Week 1-2: Treat every 5-7 seconds
- Week 3: Treat every 7-10 seconds (but always after a distraction)

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Week 3, she holds position for 45-60 seconds with 3-4 mild distractions, 8 out of 10 times.

---

## PHASE 4: TIME + DISTANCE OR DISTRACTIONS (60+ SECONDS) - WEEK 4+

### Goal:

Dog holds position for 60+ seconds while you add either distance OR bigger distractions (not both at once).

### Setup:

- Same location or slightly more distracting
- You're adding ONE of: distance OR distractions (not both)
- 10-15 reps per session, 2 sessions per day

---

### Two Paths: Choose One Per Session

#### Path A: Adding Distance

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue behavior|She does it|-|
|2|**Take 1 step back**|She holds|"GOOD"|
|3|**WAIT 5 seconds**|She holds|Toss treat to her (or step forward and give it)|
|4|**Take 1 step back again**|She holds|"GOOD"|
|5|**WAIT 5 seconds**|She holds|Toss treat|
|6|**Step back to her**|She holds|Treat|
|7|Release|She gets up|-|

**Progression:**

- Week 4: 1-2 steps away
- Week 5: 3-5 steps away
- Week 6: 10 steps away
- Week 7+: Around a corner, out of sight

---

#### Path B: Adding Bigger Distractions

|**Distraction Level**|**Examples**|**When to Introduce**|
|---|---|---|
|**Mild** (Week 3)|You shift weight, small gestures|Already done|
|**Moderate** (Week 4)|You walk around her, clap hands, drop object|Now|
|**High** (Week 5+)|Another person walks by, doorbell rings, toy on ground nearby|After moderate is solid|
|**Very High** (Week 6+)|Another dog present, food on ground, kids playing nearby|After high is solid|

---

### Training Protocol for Distractions:

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue behavior|She does it|-|
|2|**Introduce distraction** (moderate level - walk around her)|She holds|"GOOD" + treat immediately|
|3|**Remove distraction, wait 5 seconds**|She holds|"GOOD"|
|4|**Introduce distraction again** (drop object)|She holds|"GOOD" + treat|
|5|**Wait 5 seconds**|She holds|"GOOD"|
|6|Release|She gets up|-|

---

### Key Points:

**Distance vs. Distractions - Pick ONE:**

- Don't add distance AND distractions in the same session
- Master one, then add the other
- Once both are solid separately, you can combine them

**Always Return to Reward:**

- If you're working on distance, step back to her to give treats
- OR toss treats to her (but this can encourage her to break position to get them)
- Eventually she learns "you'll come back" which builds confidence

**Jackpot for Hard Stuff:**

- When she holds through a BIG distraction = 3-4 treats in a row
- When she holds while you're far away or out of sight = jackpot
- Big challenges = big rewards

**If She Breaks:**

- Make it easier: less distance, easier distraction, shorter duration
- Only progress when she's succeeding 8/10 times at current level

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Week 4, she holds position for 60+ seconds with you 5+ steps away OR with moderate distractions present, 8 out of 10 times.

---

## PHASE 5: COMBINING EVERYTHING (WEEK 8+)

Once she's solid on:

- ✅ Time (60+ seconds)
- ✅ Distance (10+ steps away or out of sight)
- ✅ Distractions (moderate to high level)

You can start combining them.

### Example Combined Challenge:

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue "down"|She downs|-|
|2|Walk 5 steps away|She holds|"GOOD"|
|3|Another person walks past (distraction)|She holds|"GOOD"|
|4|Wait 10 seconds|She holds|Walk back, give treat|
|5|Walk away again, this time 10 steps|She holds|"GOOD" from distance|
|6|Wait 20 seconds|She holds|Walk back, jackpot (3-4 treats)|
|7|Release|She gets up|-|

**Total:** 60+ second down with distance + distraction combined.

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: She Breaks Position Constantly

**Solutions:**

- You're progressing too fast - go back to shorter durations
- Reduce treat frequency (feed MORE often)
- Make sure you're using "GOOD" not "YES"
- Check that you're feeding treats IN position, not making her move to get them
- Make sure the behavior itself is solid before adding duration

---

### Problem: She's Anxious/Stressed During Duration Work

**Signs of stress:**

- Yawning, lip licking, whale eye
- Panting excessively
- Trying to leave position repeatedly
- Whining or barking

**Solutions:**

- Shorten duration significantly (back to 5-10 seconds)
- Increase treat frequency (feed every 3 seconds)
- Remove all distractions
- Practice in a place she's very comfortable
- Build confidence with easier exercises first

---

### Problem: She Anticipates the Release

**What it looks like:**

- She pops up at exactly 20 seconds every time (because that's when you always release her)
- She starts shifting/preparing to get up before you release

**Solutions:**

- Variable duration: sometimes 10 sec, sometimes 30 sec, sometimes 45 sec
- Don't always go to max duration
- Occasionally ask for very short durations (5 sec) mixed with long ones
- Release is random, unpredictable - she has to wait for your cue

---

### Problem: She'll Hold It For You But Not For Others

**Solutions:**

- Have other people practice with her (with you nearby at first)
- Other person cues behavior, you stand close and support
- Gradually fade your presence
- She needs to learn "duration applies to everyone, not just dad"

---

## INTEGRATION INTO BEHAVIORS

### **For Down:**

- After verbal cue is solid (Down Phase 5 complete)
- Start with 2 seconds (Duration Phase 1)
- Progress through 4 weeks of duration work
- Result: Solid down-stay for 60+ seconds

### **For Place:**

- After she reliably gets on the place bed (Place game is learned)
- Start with 2 seconds (Duration Phase 1)
- Progress through duration work
- Result: She stays on place bed for extended periods

### **For Sit:**

- After sit is on verbal cue
- Start with 2 seconds (Duration Phase 1)
- Sits typically need less duration work than downs (sit is harder to hold physically)
- Result: Solid sit-stay for 30-60 seconds

---

## DAILY PRACTICE INTEGRATION

### Where to Practice Duration Daily:

|**Context**|**Behavior**|**Duration Goal**|**When**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Meal prep**|Place or down|30-60 seconds|While you prepare her food|
|**Door manners**|Sit or down|10-20 seconds|Before going outside|
|**Crate exit**|Sit|5-10 seconds|Before releasing from crate|
|**Settle time**|Down or place|2-5 minutes|Evening neutral time|
|**Training sessions**|Whatever you're working on|Current phase duration|Bonus session|

---

## WEEKLY PROGRESSION TRACKING

- [ ] Day 1-2: Holds 2-4 seconds, 8/10 times
- [ ] Day 3-4: Holds 4-6 seconds, 8/10 times
- [ ] Day 5-7: Holds 6-10 seconds, 8/10 times

### Week 2 (Phase 2):

- [ ] Day 1-2: Holds 10-15 seconds, 8/10 times
- [ ] Day 3-4: Holds 15-20 seconds, 8/10 times
- [ ] Day 5-7: Holds 25-30 seconds, 8/10 times

### Week 4+ (Phase 4):

- [ ] Week 4: Holds 60 sec with you 3-5 steps away OR moderate distractions, 8/10 times
- [ ] Week 5: Holds 60 sec with you 10 steps away OR high distractions, 8/10 times
- [ ] Week 6+: Combines distance + distractions

---

## SUCCESS METRICS: DURATION IS SOLID WHEN:

✅ She holds position for 60+ seconds without fidgeting  
✅ She holds while you walk around, move, gesture  
✅ She holds while you're 10+ steps away or out of sight  
✅ She holds through moderate distractions (people walking by, objects dropping)  
✅ She doesn't anticipate the release - waits for your "break" cue  
✅ She's calm and relaxed during duration work (not stressed)

---

## FINAL NOTES

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks is typical for solid duration work across all three dimensions (time, distance, distractions).

**Most Important Rule:** Only increase ONE dimension at a time. Don't add distance AND distractions AND time all at once.

**Common Mistake:** Progressing too fast. If she's breaking position more than 2/10 times, you're moving too quickly.

**Celebrate Progress:** Going from 2 seconds to 60 seconds is HUGE. Don't wait for "perfect" to feel good about progress.

**This Applies to Everything:** Once you understand duration progression, you can apply it to ANY behavior - down, place, sit, stand, heel position, etc.

# **LET'S BUILD THAT DURATION!** 🐾

**Next up: I'll update the Down protocol to explicitly reference duration work, then we'll build the full integrated timeline.**
