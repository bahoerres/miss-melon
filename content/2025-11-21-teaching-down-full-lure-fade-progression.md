Title: Teaching Down - Full Lure Fade Progression
layout: post
---

## OVERVIEW

### What It Is:

A cue that tells your dog to lie down on the ground (belly, elbows, and hips all making contact with the floor) and hold that position until released.

### Why It Matters:

- **Foundation for impulse control:** Down is a naturally calming position
- **Essential for advanced work:** Needed for down-stays, distance work, place training
- **Real-world utility:** Settles her in public, at home, during vet visits
- **Building block:** Required before teaching down-in-motion, send-to-spot, etc.

### What Skills It Builds:

- Body awareness and control
- Patience (down is harder to hold than sit)
- Handler focus during position changes
- Foundation for calm/settle behaviors

---

## CLEAR CRITERIA: WHAT "DOWN" LOOKS LIKE

### Full Down Position:

|**Body Part**|**Criteria**|
|---|---|
|**Elbows**|Both touching the ground|
|**Belly**|Touching or very close to ground|
|**Hips**|On the ground (not hovering)|
|**Front paws**|Extended forward or tucked under|
|**Back legs**|Can be tucked (sphinx) or to the side (hip out) - both count|

**What Counts:** Elbows + belly + hips all down = full down.

**What Doesn't Count:**

- "Play bow" (butt in the air, elbows down)
- Hover down (elbows almost down but not quite touching)
- One hip up

**Be consistent.** Only mark and reward FULL downs, or she'll learn that "close enough" counts.

---

## THE FULL PROGRESSION: 7 PHASES

### Phase Overview:

|**Phase**|**Goal**|**Duration**|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|Introduce lure, get the behavior|1-3 days|
|**2**|Build speed and reliability with full lure|3-5 days|
|**3**|Fade the lure (smaller motion, empty hand)|5-7 days|
|**4**|Add verbal cue|3-5 days|
|**5**|Verbal cue only, hand signal becomes optional|5-7 days|
|**6**|Add duration (2-60+ seconds)|4 weeks|
|**7**|Add distance and distractions|2-4 weeks|

**Total timeline:** 6-10 weeks to a rock-solid down with duration, distance, and distraction-proofing.

---

## PHASE 1: INTRODUCE THE LURE (Days 1-3)

### Goal:

Get Melon to follow the lure into a down position. She learns the motion = reward.

### Setup:

- High-value treats (small, soft, smelly)
- Quiet location (living room, courtyard)
- She's standing or sitting in front of you
- 10-15 reps per session, 2-3 sessions per day

---

### Training Protocol:

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Hold treat in closed fist|Sniffs your hand|-|
|2|Lower treat slowly straight down to ground between her front paws|Follows with her nose|-|
|3|Once treat reaches ground, slowly pull it toward you (along the ground)|Her nose follows, elbows start to lower|-|
|4|Keep luring until elbows + belly + hips all touch ground|She's in full down|"YES" + open hand, give treat|
|5|Wait 1 second|She stays down|Give second treat while she's still down|
|6|Stand up, take a step back|She gets up (or cue "break" if you've taught it)|-|
|7|Reset and repeat|-|-|

---

### Key Points:

**Lure Path:**

- DOWN to the ground (not forward first - that makes her walk forward)
- THEN toward you along the ground (this folds her into a down)
- Like an "L" shape: down, then back

**If She Doesn't Lie Down:**

- Make sure treat goes all the way to the ground
- Pull it slightly under her chest (toward her back paws)
- Be patient - some dogs take 20-30 seconds to figure it out
- If she stands up and walks around the lure, reset and try again

**If She Backs Up:**

- Lure more slowly
- Make sure she's sitting first (easier to down from a sit)
- Practice near a wall so she can't back up

**Common Mistake:** Moving the treat too fast. Go SLOW. Let her figure out that lowering her body gets her closer to the treat.

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Phase 1, she follows the lure into a down position 8 out of 10 times within 10 seconds.

---

## PHASE 2: BUILD SPEED & RELIABILITY (Days 4-8)

### **Goal:**

She drops into a down quickly and reliably when she sees the lure. You're still using a full lure (treat in hand), but she's getting FAST.

### **Setup:**

- Same as Phase 1
- 15-20 reps per session, 2-3 sessions per day
- Start varying her starting position (standing, sitting, facing different directions)

---

### Training Protocol:

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Hold treat in closed fist at her nose level|Sniffs hand|-|
|2|Lure straight down to ground (faster than Phase 1)|Follows immediately|-|
|3|Pull slightly toward you if needed|Drops into down|"YES" the instant elbows hit ground|
|4|Give treat|She stays down|Give 2-3 treats in a row while down|
|5|Release ("break")|She gets up|-|
|6|Reset and repeat|-|-|

---

### Key Points:

**Build Speed:**

- She should start dropping faster (3-5 seconds instead of 10)
- If she's slow, make sure you're marking the INSTANT her elbows touch
- Speed comes from clear timing

**Add Repetitions:**

- Do 15-20 reps per session now (up from 10-15)
- She needs volume to build muscle memory

**Vary Starting Position:**

- Sometimes she's sitting
- Sometimes she's standing
- Sometimes she's slightly to your left or right
- Goal: "Down" works no matter what position she starts in

**Feed Multiple Treats:**

- Give 2-3 treats in a row while she's holding the down
- This builds duration (she learns to stay in position)
- Feed treats between her paws (not above her head - that makes her sit up)

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Phase 2, she drops into a down within 3 seconds of seeing the lure, 9 out of 10 times.

---

## PHASE 3: FADE THE LURE (Days 9-15)

### **Goal:**

She responds to your HAND MOTION (not the treat). You're transitioning from lure to hand signal.

### This Is the Hardest Phase:

Many people get stuck here because they don't fade systematically. We'll break it into 3 sub-phases.

---

### Phase 3A: Smaller Lure Motion (Days 9-11)

**What You're Doing:**

- Still have treat in hand, but make the motion smaller and faster
- Instead of slowly lowering treat all the way to ground, you drop your hand halfway and she should anticipate the rest

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Treat in fist, start at her nose level|Watching your hand|-|
|2|Drop hand HALFWAY to ground (not all the way)|She starts to lower|-|
|3|Stop your hand motion|She completes the down on her own|"YES" the instant elbows hit|
|4|Bring treat down to her and give it|She's in full down|Feed 2-3 treats|
|5|Release|She gets up|-|

**Goal:** She anticipates the down and completes it even though your hand didn't go all the way to the ground.

**Reps:** 15-20 per session, 2 sessions per day for 2-3 days.

---

### Phase 3B: Empty Hand Motion (Days 12-14)

**What You're Doing:**

- Treat is in your OTHER hand (behind your back or in your pocket)
- Your lure hand is EMPTY but makes the same motion
- She downs, THEN you produce the treat from the other hand

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Empty fist in front of her nose (treat in other hand)|Sniffs empty hand|-|
|2|Drop empty hand halfway to ground|She follows the motion and downs|"YES" when elbows hit|
|3|Immediately grab treat from other hand|She holds down|Give treat between her paws|
|4|Release|She gets up|-|

**This Is the Critical Step:** She's now responding to the MOTION, not the treat. The treat appears AFTER the behavior.

**If She Doesn't Down with Empty Hand:**

- Go back to Phase 3A for another day
- Make sure your hand motion is exactly the same as when you had the treat
- Be patient - this is a big leap for her brain

**Reps:** 15-20 per session, 2-3 sessions per day for 2-3 days.

---

### Phase 3C: Subtle Hand Signal (Day 15)

**What You're Doing:**

- Your hand motion gets even smaller
- Eventually it's just a small downward point or finger motion
- Treat still comes from other hand after the behavior

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Small downward motion (just a few inches)|She downs immediately|"YES"|
|2|Treat from other hand|She holds down|Give treat|
|3|Release|She gets up|-|

**Goal:** Your hand signal is now a subtle cue, not a big lure motion.

**Reps:** 10-15 per session, 2 sessions per day.

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Phase 3, she downs reliably (9/10 times) when you make a small hand motion, with no treat visible in that hand.

---

## PHASE 4: ADD VERBAL CUE (Days 16-20)

### Goal:

Pair the word "down" with the hand signal so she starts to learn the verbal cue.

### Critical Rule:

**VERBAL CUE COMES FIRST, THEN HAND SIGNAL.**

If you do hand signal first, she'll always rely on the visual and ignore the word.

---

### Training Protocol:

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Say "DOWN"|She might look at you, might not move|-|
|2|**Immediately** (within 0.5 seconds) give hand signal|She downs|"YES" when elbows hit|
|3|Treat from other hand|She holds down|Give treat|
|4|Release|She gets up|-|

**Timing Is Everything:**

- Say "down"
- Count "one-thousand-one"
- Give hand signal
- She downs

**After 20-30 Reps:** She'll start to anticipate. When you say "down," she'll begin moving BEFORE you give the hand signal. That's exactly what you want.

**Reps:** 15-20 per session, 2-3 sessions per day for 4-5 days.

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Phase 4, she starts moving into a down when she hears "down," before you give the hand signal (at least 5 out of 10 times).

---

## PHASE 5: VERBAL CUE ONLY (Days 21-27)

### Goal:

She responds to "down" with no hand signal needed. Hand signal becomes backup/optional.

---

### Phase 5A: Test the Verbal Cue (Days 21-23)

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Say "DOWN"|**WAIT 2-3 seconds**|-|
|2|Does she down?|**YES:** She downs on verbal only|"YES" + jackpot (3-4 treats)|
|2|Does she down?|**NO:** She doesn't move|Give hand signal as backup|
|3|Release|She gets up|-|

**The Test:**

- 50% of reps: Verbal only, wait to see if she does it
- 50% of reps: Verbal + immediate hand signal (to keep reinforcing the pairing)

**Reps:** 10-15 per session, 2 sessions per day.

---

### Phase 5B: Increase Verbal-Only Success Rate (Days 24-27)

**As She Gets Better:**

- Gradually increase percentage of verbal-only trials
- Day 24: 60% verbal only
- Day 25: 70% verbal only
- Day 26: 80% verbal only
- Day 27: 90% verbal only

**If She Doesn't Respond to Verbal:**

- Wait 3 seconds
- Give hand signal as backup
- Don't punish or get frustrated - just mark and reward the down
- Try again next rep

**Reps:** 10-15 per session, 2 sessions per day.

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Phase 5, she responds to "down" (verbal only) 8-9 out of 10 times, with no hand signal needed.

---

## PHASE 6: ADD DURATION (Weeks 5-8)

### Goal:

She holds the down position for extended periods (2 seconds → 60+ seconds).

### When to Start:

Only begin Phase 6 after she's responding reliably to verbal "down" cue (Phase 5 complete).

---

### Duration Progression:

This follows the **"Adding Duration to Any Behavior"** protocol. Here's the condensed version for down specifically:

|**Week**|**Duration Goal**|**Focus**|
|---|---|---|
|**Week 5**|2-10 seconds|Time only, you're right next to her|
|**Week 6**|10-30 seconds|Extended time, reduce treat frequency|
|**Week 7**|30-60 seconds|Add mild distractions (your movement)|
|**Week 8**|60+ seconds|Time is solid, ready for distance/bigger distractions|

---

### Week 5: Time Only (2-10 Seconds)

**Protocol:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue "down"|She downs|-|
|2|**WAIT 2 seconds**|She holds down|"GOOD" (calm marker)|
|3|Feed treat between her paws|She stays down|-|
|4|**WAIT 2 more seconds**|She holds|"GOOD" + treat|
|5|Release ("break")|She gets up|-|

**Progression:**

- Days 1-2: 2-4 seconds
- Days 3-4: 4-6 seconds
- Days 5-7: 6-10 seconds

**Key:** Use calm "GOOD" not excited "YES" during duration work.

---

### Week 6: Extended Time (10-30 Seconds)

**Protocol:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue "down"|She downs|-|
|2|**WAIT 5 seconds**|She holds|"GOOD" (verbal only, no treat)|
|3|Feed treat|She stays|-|
|4|**WAIT 5 seconds**|She holds|"GOOD" + treat|
|5|**WAIT 5 seconds**|She holds|"GOOD" + treat|
|6|Release|She gets up|-|

**Progression:**

- Days 1-2: 10-15 seconds
- Days 3-4: 15-20 seconds
- Days 5-7: 25-30 seconds

**Key:** Reduce treat frequency (every 5-7 seconds instead of every 2-3).

---

### Week 7: Mild Distractions (30-60 Seconds)

**Add these distractions while she holds the down:**

- You shift your weight
- You take 1-2 small steps side to side
- You wave your arms or gesture
- You look around, scratch your head

**Protocol:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue "down"|She downs|-|
|2|**Add distraction** (shift weight)|She holds despite distraction|"GOOD" + treat immediately|
|3|**WAIT 5 seconds, neutral**|She holds|"GOOD"|
|4|**Add distraction** (take small step)|She holds|"GOOD" + treat|
|5|**WAIT 5 seconds**|She holds|"GOOD" + treat|
|6|Release|She gets up|-|

**Key:** Always reward immediately after she holds through a distraction.

---

### Week 8: Solid Duration (60+ Seconds)

By end of Week 8, she should be able to:

- Hold a down for 60+ seconds
- With you standing right next to her
- With mild distractions (your movement)
- With 3-4 treat deliveries during the duration

**Success Metric:** She holds down for 60 seconds with mild distractions, 8/10 times.

---

## PHASE 7: ADD DISTANCE & BIGGER DISTRACTIONS (Weeks 9-12+)

### Goal:

She holds the down while you move away OR while bigger distractions occur (not both at once initially).

### When to Start:

Only after duration is solid at 60+ seconds (Phase 6 complete).

---

### Two Paths: Distance OR Distractions

#### Path A: Adding Distance

|**Week**|**Distance Goal**|**Protocol**|
|---|---|---|
|**Week 9**|1-2 steps away|Cue down → take 1 step back → wait 5 sec → treat → release|
|**Week 10**|3-5 steps away|Cue down → take 3 steps back → wait 10 sec → return and treat → release|
|**Week 11**|10 steps away|Cue down → walk 10 steps → wait 15 sec → return and jackpot → release|
|**Week 12+**|Out of sight|Cue down → step around corner → wait 20 sec → return and jackpot → release|

**Key:** Always return to her to give treats (or toss them to her, but returning builds confidence).

---

#### Path B: Adding Bigger Distractions

|**Week**|**Distraction Level**|**Examples**|
|---|---|---|
|**Week 9**|Moderate|You walk fully around her, clap hands, drop objects|
|**Week 10**|High|Another person walks by, doorbell rings, toy on ground nearby|
|**Week 11**|Very High|Another dog visible at distance, food on ground, kids playing nearby|
|**Week 12+**|Real-world|Practice in public (parks, cafes, busy sidewalks)|

**Key:** Always jackpot when she holds through a big distraction.

---

### Combining Distance + Distractions (Week 13+)

Once both are solid separately, you can combine them:

- Cue "down"
- Walk 5 steps away
- Have someone walk past (distraction)
- She holds
- Return and jackpot
- Release

---

### Success Metric:

By end of Phase 7, she holds down for 60+ seconds with you 10+ steps away or out of sight, OR with high-level distractions present, 8/10 times.

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: She Won't Lie Down with the Lure

**Solutions:**

- Make sure lure goes ALL THE WAY to the ground
- Pull it slightly back toward her chest/under her
- Try when she's already sitting (easier to down from sit)
- Use higher value treats
- Practice on a soft surface (carpet, grass) - some dogs don't like hard floors
- Be patient - it can take 30+ seconds the first few times

---

### Problem: She Stands Up and Walks Around the Lure

**Solutions:**

- Lure more slowly
- Start with her in a sit
- Practice with her back to a wall (can't back up or walk around)
- Make sure treat is on the ground, not hovering above it

---

### Problem: She Gets Stuck in Phase 3 (Won't Down with Empty Hand)

**Solutions:**

- Go back to Phase 2 for 1-2 more days (build more reps with full lure)
- Make sure your empty-hand motion is EXACTLY the same as your lure motion
- Start with treat in your hand, do 3 reps, then switch to empty hand for 1 rep, then back to treat for 3 reps (intermittent)
- Be patient - this is the hardest phase

---

### Problem: She Only Responds to Hand Signal, Ignores Verbal Cue

**Solutions:**

- Make sure you're saying "down" BEFORE the hand signal (not at the same time)
- Increase the delay between verbal and hand signal (up to 2-3 seconds)
- Do more reps in Phase 4 before moving to Phase 5
- When testing verbal only, wait a full 3 seconds before giving hand signal backup

---

### Problem: She Does a "Hover Down" (Elbows Almost Down But Not Quite)

**Solutions:**

- Don't mark or reward hover downs - only mark full downs
- If she hovers, wait 2-3 seconds to see if she commits
- If she doesn't commit, stand up and reset (no reward)
- Make sure you're feeding treats BETWEEN her front paws (not above her head)
- Be consistent - if you reward hover downs, she'll think that's acceptable

---

### Problem: She Breaks Position During Duration Work

**Solutions:**

- You're progressing too fast - go back to shorter durations
- Feed treats MORE often (every 3-5 seconds instead of 7-10)
- Make sure you're using "GOOD" not "YES"
- Check that you're feeding treats between her paws (keeps her in position)
- Remove distractions and just work on time first

---

### Problem: She's Anxious/Stressed During Down Work

**Signs of stress:**

- Yawning, lip licking, whale eye
- Panting excessively
- Trying to leave position repeatedly
- Whining

**Solutions:**

- Shorten duration significantly
- Increase treat frequency
- Practice in a place she's very comfortable
- Make sure down itself is solid before adding duration
- Build confidence with easier exercises first

---

## INTEGRATION INTO DAILY ROUTINE

### Where to Practice "Down" Daily:

|**Context**|**When**|**Phase/Focus**|**Reps**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Bonus Training Session**|Afternoon (3:45pm)|Current phase you're in|10-15|
|**Courtyard Session**|3pm (end of session)|Quick maintenance|3-5|
|**Before Meals**|Breakfast & dinner|Test/maintenance|2|
|**Meal Prep**|While preparing her food|Duration practice (Phase 6+)|1 long hold|
|**Settle Time**|Evening neutral time|Duration practice (Phase 6+)|1-2 long holds|
|**Random Throughout Day**|Whenever|Generalization|3-5|

**Total daily reps:** 20-30+ (plenty to progress through phases)

## SUCCESS METRICS: "DOWN" IS SOLID WHEN:

✅ She drops into down within 2 seconds of hearing "down" (verbal only)  
✅ No hand signal needed (though you can still use it as backup)  
✅ Works from any starting position (sitting, standing, walking)  
✅ Works in different locations (apartment, courtyard, parents' house, public)  
✅ She holds the down for 60+ seconds  
✅ She holds while you're 10+ steps away or out of sight  
✅ She holds through moderate to high distractions  
✅ She's calm and relaxed during down work (not stressed)  
✅ You feel confident cueing it anywhere

## FINAL NOTES

**Timeline:** 6-10 weeks is typical for a rock-solid down with duration and distraction-proofing. Don't rush it.

**Most Important Phases:**

- Phase 3 (fading the lure) - where most people get stuck
- Phase 6 (duration) - builds the real-world utility of the behavior

**Common Mistake:** Moving to duration work (Phase 6) before the verbal cue is solid (Phase 5). Make sure she's responding to "down" reliably before you add duration.

**Celebrate Progress:** Every phase completion is a win. Going from lure-dependent to verbal-only to 60-second hold is HUGE progress.

**This Is a Foundation Skill:** Once down is solid, you can use it everywhere - settling at home, calming in public, foundation for place work, distance work, and more.
