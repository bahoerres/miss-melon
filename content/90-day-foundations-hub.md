## 90-Day Foundations Program - Complete Hub

Building Excellence While Preventing Problems.

This is your 90-day roadmap to transform your dog's training. You'll build handler focus, emotional regulation, and impulse control through three intensive cycles and a daily non-negotiable anchor session.

---

## Quick Overview

**Timeline:** November 20, 2025 - February 20, 2026 (90 days)

**What You're Building:**
- Rock-solid marker response
- Default handler focus
- Emotional regulation and arousal control
- Impulse control and patience
- Foundation ready for advanced obedience

**The Core Promise:**
By February 20th, Melon can confidently perform all 15 games from the three cycles in any situation, with handler focus as her default and the ability to regulate her own arousal.

---

## The Three Cycles

| Cycle | Dates | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| **[[90-day-foundations-cycle-1|Cycle 1: Confidence & Engagement]]** | Nov 20 - Dec 20 | Building confidence, problem-solving, handler focus | 5 games mastered, handler focus as default |
| **[[90-day-foundations-cycle-2|Cycle 2: Emotional Regulation]]** | Dec 21 - Jan 20 | Arousal control, drive channeling, start/stop switches | 5 games mastered, go from 100 to 0 in 30 seconds |
| **[[90-day-foundations-cycle-3|Cycle 3: Impulse Control & Precision]]** | Jan 21 - Feb 20 | Patience under pressure, frustration tolerance, reliability | 5 games mastered, rock-solid impulse control |

---

## The Non-Negotiable: 3PM Courtyard Session

This session happens **every single day, no matter what.** This is your foundation anchor.

**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Structure:**
- Minutes 0-4: Marker Conditioning (15-20 reps, high energy)
- Minutes 4-10: Engagement Work (eye contact, proximity, sit reps)

**Why This Matters:**
- Builds bulletproof marker response
- Creates default handler focus
- Establishes daily training habit
- Takes 10 minutes but compounds over 90 days

## Key Success Principles

### Progress, Not Perfection

- Some weeks will be great
- Some weeks will be harder
- Both are part of the journey
- Imperfect consistency beats perfect planning

### Weekly Reflection

At the end of each week, reflect on:

**Avoidant Goals (Preventing Problems):**
- Did we avoid rehearsing bad patterns?
- Did I keep her under threshold?
- Did I manage high-arousal situations well?
- Is she checking in MORE, not less?
- Are recovery times getting faster?

**Aspirational Goals (Building Excellence):**
- Did we make progress on this week's game?
- Is her marker response getting faster?
- Is her engagement improving?
- Is she showing toy/tug drive?
- Can she problem-solve without giving up?

### Flexibility

- If you need to repeat a week, that's fine
- If she's ahead of schedule, that's also fine
- The timeline is a guide, not a prison
- Celebrate small wins - every phase completion matters
