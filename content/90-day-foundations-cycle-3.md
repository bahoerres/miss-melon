## Cycle 3: Impulse Control & Precision

**Duration:** January 21 - February 20, 2026 (30 days)

**Goal:** By February 20th, Melon has rock-solid impulse control. She can wait patiently for food, hold behaviors with distractions, and work through frustrating challenges without quitting. She's ready for advanced obedience work.

**Outcome:** Patience under pressure, frustration tolerance, reliability and precision in behavior.

---

## The 5 Games

### 1. Pause for Food Challenge (Week 1)
**What:** Impulse control with high-value reward - wait before eating despite wanting to
**Why:** Foundation for impulse control, patience, ability to delay gratification
**Week 1 Goal:** Waits patiently without stealing food

### 2. Stack an Object (Week 2)
**What:** Precision + sustained focus - carefully stack or arrange an object
**Why:** Builds precision, sustained focus, problem-solving under pressure
**Week 2 Goal:** Can stack object reliably (this one takes time to perfect)

### 3. Crawl Under Obstacles (Week 3)
**What:** Body control + patience - crawl under low objects slowly without rushing
**Why:** Body awareness, controlled movement, patience, precision
**Week 3 Goal:** Crawls under table, chair, low obstacles calmly

### 4. Ignore That (Week 4)
**What:** Delayed gratification - looks at you despite visible food elsewhere
**Why:** Advanced impulse control, handler focus over environment
**Week 4 Goal:** Pays attention to you even when food is visible

### 5. Integration & Assessment (Week 5)
**What:** Run all Cycle 3 games in sequence under pressure
**Why:** Prove patience and impulse control are solid
**Week 5 Goal:** All games work with distractions and pressure

## Weekly Game Focus

| Week | Dates | Game | What You're Building |
|------|-------|------|----------------------|
| **1** | Jan 21-27 | Pause for Food | Impulse control with high-value reward |
| **2** | Jan 28 - Feb 3 | Stack an Object | Precision + sustained focus |
| **3** | Feb 4-10 | Crawl Under Obstacles | Body control + patience |
| **4** | Feb 11-17 | Ignore That | Delayed gratification |
| **5** | Feb 18-20 | Integration & Assessment | Patience under pressure |

---

## Week 1: Pause for Food Challenge (Jan 21-27)

### Goal
She waits patiently for food without stealing, even with high-value treats visible.

### Daily Training Plan

| Session | What to Do | Success Metric |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **3pm Courtyard** | Marker + Engagement (standard) | Consistent check-ins |
| **Bonus Session** | Pause for Food (10-15 min) | See weekly progression |

### Progression

| Days | Focus | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| 1-2 | Bowl in hand, wait for her to pause, then release | She waits 3-5 seconds |
| 3-4 | Increase duration, hand gets closer to her | She doesn't steal |
| 5-6 | Set bowl on ground at distance first | She waits before moving toward it |
| 7 | Bowl on ground nearby, she waits | Rock-solid pause |

### Success Metric
She waits patiently without stealing, even with high-value treats visible.

---

## Week 2: Stack an Object (Jan 28 - Feb 3)

### Goal
She can stack/arrange an object reliably. (Note: This one takes time to perfect.)

### What Stacking Looks Like

Arrange an object (blocks, rings, items) in a pattern. She nudges/moves/stacks them following your guidance.

### Progression

| Days | Focus | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| 1-2 | Shape toward nose-touching one object | She makes contact |
| 3-4 | Lure movement, shape into arrangement | She's starting to interact |
| 5-6 | Practice arrangement pattern | Building familiarity |
| 7 | Reliable stacking attempts | Making progress |

### Important Note

Stack is a complex behavior. You might not get a perfect stack by Week 2's end, and that's fine. The goal is progress and building the foundation.

### Success Metric
She's making reliable progress toward stacking. She understands she needs to interact with the objects in a specific way.

---

## Week 3: Crawl Under Obstacles (Feb 4-10)

### Goal
She crawls under tables, chairs, and low obstacles calmly without rushing.

### What Crawl Looks Like

She goes under obstacles slowly, controlled, without panicking or rushing. Body low, careful movement.

### Progression

| Days | Focus | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| 1-2 | Lure under low table, very short distance | She goes under willingly |
| 3-4 | Longer distance, still very low | She moves slowly |
| 5-6 | Different obstacles, add slight height | Works under various obstacles |
| 7 | Multiple obstacles, generalize | Crawls calmly anywhere |

### Success Metric
She crawls under low obstacles calmly and controlled, without rushing or panicking.

---

## Week 4: Ignore That (Feb 11-17)

### Goal
She pays attention to you even when visible food/toys are present elsewhere.

### What Ignore That Looks Like

Put food or toy on ground nearby. She looks at you instead of the food. She focuses on you despite the temptation.

### Progression

| Days | Focus | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| 1-2 | Food visible, she makes eye contact with you | She looks at you first |
| 3-4 | Food closer, wait longer for eye contact | She still chooses you |
| 5-6 | Toy or food slightly more tempting | She stays focused on you |
| 7 | High-value item visible, she ignores it | Solid eye contact, ignores item |

### Success Metric
She consistently pays attention to you and makes eye contact, even when high-value food or toys are visible.

---

## Week 5: Integration & Assessment (Feb 18-20)

### Goal
Run all 5 Cycle 3 games in sequence and assess impulse control progress.

### Assessment: Impulse Control Test

Run all 5 games with escalating difficulty/distractions:

1. **Pause for Food** - With high-value treat visible nearby
2. **Stack an Object** - With her favorite toy visible
3. **Crawl Under** - With another dog or person present
4. **Ignore That** - Multiple items visible, high-value stuff
5. *Integration* - All in sequence under pressure

### Reflection Questions

- Does she wait patiently for food?
- Can she work through frustration (Stack)?
- Can she maintain control under pressure (Crawl)?
- Does she choose you over environment (Ignore)?
- Is she rock-solid on impulse control?

### Outcome

By end of this week, she should have rock-solid impulse control across all games.

## Key Principles for Cycle 3

### Patience Is Teachable
- Some dogs learn it faster than others
- Consistency is key
- She needs to learn patience = reward

### Frustration Is the Enemy (And Also the Teacher)
- She'll get frustrated with harder challenges
- Your job is to manage her frustration level
- Make it hard enough to build resilience, not so hard she gives up

### Precision Matters
- These games teach HOW to think
- Not just the behavior, but the mindset
- Patience, impulse control, and precision are life skills

### Real-World Application
- These games translate to:
  - Waiting at doors
  - Not counter-surfing
  - Settling during vet visits
  - Respecting other dogs' space
  - Paying attention despite distractions

---

## Troubleshooting Cycle 3

### If She Breaks and Steals Food
- Go back to shorter waits
- Increase distance (food further away)
- Build foundation more gradually

### If Stack is Too Frustrating
- Break it into smaller steps
- Make it easier (fewer objects)
- Increase frequency of rewards

### If She Rushes Through Crawl
- Lure more slowly
- Reward heavily for slow movement
- Practice in confined space first

### If She Can't Ignore the Item
- Start with lower-value items
- Increase distance (item further away)
- Build up gradually
