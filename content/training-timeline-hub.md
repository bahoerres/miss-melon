## Key Success Principles

### Progress Over Perfection

- Some weeks will be great
- Some weeks will be harder
- Both are part of the journey
- Imperfect consistency beats perfect planning

### Flexibility Within Structure

- If you need to repeat a week, that's fine
- If she's ahead of schedule, keep to timeline
- The timeline is a guide, not a prison
- Adjust based on HER progress, not the calendar

### The Anchor Holds Everything

The **3pm courtyard session** is non-negotiable because:
- It's short (10 min) = sustainable
- It's consistent = builds habit
- It covers the basics = everything else builds on it
- It compounds = 150 days of daily work = transformation

### Real-World Integration

Training shouldn't be separate from life. It IS life:
- Meals = training opportunities
- Walks = training time
- Play = training
- Settle time = training
