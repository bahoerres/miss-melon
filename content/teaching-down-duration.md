## Phase 6: Add Duration

**Timeline:** Weeks 5-8 (4 weeks total)

**Goal:** She holds the down position for extended periods (2 seconds → 10 seconds → 30 seconds → 60+ seconds).

---

## When to Start Phase 6

**Only begin after she's responding reliably to verbal "down" cue (Phase 5 complete).**

She should be downing 8-9/10 times on the verbal cue with no hand signal.

---

## Duration Progression Overview

| Week | Duration Goal | Focus |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Week 5** | 2-10 seconds | Time only, you're right next to her |
| **Week 6** | 10-30 seconds | Extended time, reduce treat frequency |
| **Week 7** | 30-60 seconds | Add mild distractions (your movement) |
| **Week 8** | 60+ seconds | Time is solid, ready for distance/bigger distractions |

---

## Critical Marker Difference

### Use "GOOD" Not "YES"

- **"YES"** = excited marker that makes her want to pop up and come to you
- **"GOOD"** = calm marker that means "keep doing what you're doing, more is coming"
- Reserve **"YES"** for when you're RELEASING her from the position

---

## Week 5: Time Only (2-10 Seconds)

### Goal

She holds down for 2-10 seconds while you stand still right next to her, no distractions.

### Training Protocol

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Cue "down" | She downs | - |
| 2 | **WAIT 2 seconds** | She holds down | "GOOD" (calm marker) |
| 3 | Feed treat between her paws | She stays down | - |
| 4 | **WAIT 2 more seconds** | She holds | "GOOD" + treat |
| 5 | Release ("break") | She gets up | - |

**Total duration:** 4 seconds (2 sec + treat + 2 sec + treat + release)

### Progression Through Week 5

| Days | Duration Goal | Protocol |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **1-2** | 2-4 seconds | Wait 2 sec → treat → wait 2 sec → treat → release |
| **3-4** | 4-6 seconds | Wait 2 sec → treat → wait 2 sec → treat → wait 2 sec → treat → release |
| **5-6** | 6-10 seconds | Wait 3 sec → treat → wait 3 sec → treat → wait 3 sec → treat → release |
| **7** | Test 10 seconds | Wait full 10 seconds, treat at 3, 6, 9 seconds, release at 10 |

### Key Points

**Feed Treats IN POSITION:**

- For down: Between her front paws (not above her head - that makes her sit up)
- Goal: She learns "staying here = treats keep coming"

**Start Small:**

- 2 seconds feels ridiculously short, but it's building the foundation
- If you start with 10 seconds right away, she'll break position and learn that's okay
- Build gradually so she succeeds at every step

**If She Breaks Position:**

- Don't reward
- Reset and try again with SHORTER duration (make it easier)
- Only increase duration when she's succeeding 8/10 times at current level

### Success Metric for Week 5

By end of Week 5, she holds position for 10 seconds with 2-3 treat deliveries, **8 out of 10 times**.

---

## Week 6: Extended Time (10-30 Seconds)

### Goal

She holds position for 10-30 seconds. You're still right next to her, no distractions.

### Training Protocol

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Cue "down" | She downs | - |
| 2 | **WAIT 5 seconds** | She holds | "GOOD" at 3 seconds (verbal only, no treat yet) |
| 3 | Feed treat in position | She stays | - |
| 4 | **WAIT 5 more seconds** | She holds | "GOOD" at 3 seconds |
| 5 | Feed treat | She stays | - |
| 6 | **WAIT 5 more seconds** | She holds | "GOOD" |
| 7 | Feed treat | She stays | - |
| 8 | Release ("break") | She gets up | - |

**Total duration:** ~15 seconds

### Progression Through Week 6

| Days | Duration Goal | How Many Treats |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **1-2** | 10-15 seconds | 2-3 treats |
| **3-4** | 15-20 seconds | 3-4 treats |
| **5-6** | 20-25 seconds | 3-4 treats |
| **7** | 25-30 seconds | 4-5 treats |

### Key Points

**Reduce Treat Frequency:**

- Week 5: Treat every 2-3 seconds
- Week 6: Treat every 5-7 seconds
- She's learning to hold longer between rewards

**Use Verbal "GOOD" Between Treats:**

- Say "good" calmly every few seconds even when you're not giving a treat
- This keeps her engaged and reassures her she's doing the right thing
- Helps bridge the gap between treats

**Variable Duration:**

- Don't always go to the max duration
- Mix it up: sometimes release at 10 seconds, sometimes 20, sometimes 30
- This prevents her from anticipating the release at a specific time

**If She Gets Wiggly:**

- She's not ready for that duration yet
- Go back to shorter durations for another day
- Make sure you're feeding enough treats to keep her motivated

### Success Metric for Week 6

By end of Week 6, she holds position for 30 seconds with 4-5 treat deliveries, **8 out of 10 times**.

---

## Week 7: Mild Distractions (30-60 Seconds)

### Goal

She holds position for 30-60 seconds while mild distractions occur. You're still close to her.

### Mild Distractions to Add

| Days | Distraction | What You Do |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **1-2** | Your movement | Shift weight, scratch your head, look around |
| **3-4** | Small steps | Take 1-2 steps side to side (not away) |
| **5-6** | Hand movements | Wave your arms, clap softly, gesture |
| **7** | Combination | Move, gesture, shift - multiple mild distractions |

### Training Protocol

| Step | You Do | She Does | You Mark/Reward |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Cue "down" | She downs | - |
| 2 | **WAIT 5 seconds, then add distraction** (shift weight, take small step) | She holds despite distraction | "GOOD" + treat immediately |
| 3 | **WAIT 5 seconds, neutral** | She holds | "GOOD" |
| 4 | **Add distraction** (wave arm) | She holds | "GOOD" + treat |
| 5 | **WAIT 5 seconds** | She holds | "GOOD" |
| 6 | **Add distraction** | She holds | "GOOD" + treat |
| 7 | Release ("break") | She gets up | - |

**Total duration:** 30+ seconds with 3-4 distractions

### Key Points

**Reward DURING/AFTER Distractions:**

- If she holds position while you move = immediate treat
- This teaches "when distractions happen, holding position = big reward"

**Keep Distractions Mild:**

- Week 7 is NOT the time for big movements, loud noises, or other dogs
- You're just adding small things: your movement, gestures, shifting
- Goal: She learns to hold position even when things aren't perfectly still

**If She Breaks During Distraction:**

- The distraction was too hard
- Go back to easier distractions (just shifting weight)
- Build up more gradually

**Start Reducing Treat Frequency:**

- Week 1-2: Treat every 5-7 seconds
- Week 3: Treat every 7-10 seconds (but always after a distraction)

### Success Metric for Week 7

By end of Week 7, she holds position for 45-60 seconds with 3-4 mild distractions, **8 out of 10 times**.

---

## Week 8: Solid Duration (60+ Seconds)

### Goal

She can hold down for 60+ seconds reliably with mild distractions present.

### What You're Doing

- Same as Week 7, but she's demonstrating it consistently
- Varying the duration (sometimes 30 sec, sometimes 45, sometimes 60)
- Building confidence in her ability to hold

### Success Metric for Week 8

She holds down for 60+ seconds with mild distractions, **8/10 times**.

---

## Integration Into Daily Routine

### Where to Practice Duration Daily

| Context | When | Focus | Example |
|---------|------|-------|---------|
| **Meal prep** | Breakfast & dinner | 30-60 seconds | While you prepare her food, she holds down |
| **Settle time** | Evening | 2-5 minutes | She settles on a mat during calm time |
| **Training session** | Afternoon (3:45pm) | Current phase | Dedicated duration practice |
| **Random throughout day** | Whenever | Generalization | Quick 10-20 sec holds |

---

## Troubleshooting Week 5-8

### Problem: She Breaks Position Constantly

**Solutions:**
- You're progressing too fast - go back to shorter durations
- Feed treats MORE often (every 3 seconds instead of 5-7)
- Make sure you're using "GOOD" not "YES"
- Check that you're feeding treats IN position, not making her move to get them

### Problem: She's Anxious/Stressed During Duration

**Signs:** Yawning, lip licking, whale eye, panting, whining

**Solutions:**
- Shorten duration significantly (back to 5-10 seconds)
- Increase treat frequency (feed every 3 seconds)
- Remove all distractions
- Practice in a place she's very comfortable
- Build confidence with easier exercises first

### Problem: She Anticipates the Release

**What it looks like:** She pops up at exactly the same time every session

**Solutions:**
- Variable duration: sometimes 10 sec, sometimes 30 sec, sometimes 45 sec
- Don't always go to max duration
- Release is random, unpredictable - she has to wait for your cue
