title: Teaching Break (Release Cue) - Training Protocol
layout: post
---

## **THE PROBLEM**

**What's Happening:**

- Sometimes Melon breaks when you say "break"
- Sometimes she just sits there staring at you
- She hasn't connected "break" = "you're done, you can move now"
- You're not always sure if she's "in position" to release from

**Why This Happens:** "Break" hasn't been taught systematically as a distinct behavior. It's just a word you sometimes say, without clear meaning or consistent pattern.

---

## **THE TWO-PART ISSUE**

### **Problem 1: "Break" Isn't Clear to Her Yet**

She doesn't understand that "break" means "you're released from that behavior, you can move now."

### **Problem 2: You Can't Always Tell If She's "In Position"**

Without clear visibility (mesh crate) or clear criteria (what counts as "on place"?), you can't confidently release her FROM a behavior.

**Solution:** Define clear criteria + teach "break" systematically.

---

## **STEP 1: DEFINE YOUR POSITIONS CLEARLY**

Before you can release her, you need to know EXACTLY what you're releasing her from.

### **Clear Criteria for Each Behavior:**

|**Behavior**|**Clear Criteria**|**How You Know She's "In It"**|
|---|---|---|
|**Place**|All 4 paws on the bed|You can see all 4 paws touching the bed|
|**Sit**|Butt on ground, front paws on ground|You can see her butt down, not shifting weight|
|**Down**|Belly on ground, elbows down|You can see her elbows touching ground|
|**Wait (meals)**|Not moving toward bowl|She's stationary (sit/stand/down - doesn't matter)|

**Write these down.** Your criteria need to be binary: "Is she in position? Yes or no?"

---

## **STEP 2: TEACH "BREAK" AS A STANDALONE BEHAVIOR**

### **Phase 1: Place Bed + Toss (Building the Association)**

**Goal:** She learns "break" = permission to leave the bed.

**Training Protocol:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**Result**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue "place"|Gets on bed (all 4 paws)|-|
|2|Wait 2 seconds|Stays on bed|-|
|3|Say "BREAK" + toss treat off bed|Jumps off to get treat|Learns "break" = leave the bed|

**Frequency:** 20 reps per session, 2-3 sessions per day for 3 days.

**Success Metric:** She consistently leaves the bed when she hears "break."

---

### **Phase 2: Place Bed + Delay the Toss (Building the Cue)**

**Goal:** She starts moving when she hears "break," BEFORE you toss the treat.

**Training Protocol:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**Result**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue "place"|Gets on bed|-|
|2|Wait 3-5 seconds|Stays on bed|-|
|3|Say "BREAK"|**WAIT 1 SECOND**|She should start to move|
|4|Toss treat as she's moving off|Gets treat|"Break" = the CUE, not just a word with the toss|

**Frequency:** 15-20 reps per session, 2-3 sessions per day for 3-5 days.

**Success Metric:** She begins moving off the bed when she hears "break," before the treat is tossed.

---

### **Phase 3: Place Bed + No Toss Needed (Cue is Established)**

**Goal:** "Break" is a real release cue that works without luring.

**Training Protocol:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**Result**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Cue "place"|Gets on bed|-|
|2|Wait 5 seconds|Stays on bed|-|
|3|Say "BREAK"|Gets off bed on her own|Jackpot reward AFTER she's off|

**Frequency:** 10-15 reps per session, 2-3 sessions per day for 3-5 days.

**Success Metric:** She reliably leaves the bed when she hears "break," no toss needed.

---

## **STEP 3: GENERALIZE "BREAK" TO OTHER BEHAVIORS**

Once it's solid on the place bed, apply the same pattern to other behaviors.

### **For Sit:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|
|---|---|---|
|1|Cue "sit"|Sits (butt on ground)|
|2|Wait 3 seconds|Holds the sit|
|3|Say "BREAK" + toss treat away|Gets up to get treat|

**Progress through phases:** Toss → Delay → No toss needed

---

### **For Meal Wait:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|
|---|---|---|
|1|Set bowl down, say "wait"|Stays back (any position)|
|2|Wait 3-5 seconds|Holds position|
|3|Say "BREAK"|Moves toward bowl|

**Note:** No toss needed here - the bowl is the reward.

---

### **For Crate Exit (With Wire Crate):**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|
|---|---|---|
|1|Approach crate|She's sitting inside (butt down)|
|2|Open door fully|Holds position (visible through wire)|
|3|Say "BREAK"|Exits crate|
|4|Reward immediately outside|Gets treat/praise|

**Benefit of wire crate:** Clear visibility = you can see exactly when she's holding vs. breaking position.

---

## **THRESHOLD MANNERS PROTOCOL (WIRE CRATE)**

Once you have the wire crate, combine "break" training with threshold manners.

### **Full Protocol:**

|**Step**|**You Do**|**She Does**|**You Mark/Reward**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Approach crate door|Anything (sitting, standing, etc.)|-|
|2|Put hand on door latch|If she moves toward door, freeze and wait|-|
|3|Wait|She sits or settles back|"GOOD" (calm marker)|
|4|Open door 1 inch|If she moves, close door immediately|-|
|5|Wait|She stays in position|"GOOD"|
|6|Open door fully|She HOLDS position|"GOOD"|
|7|Say "BREAK"|NOW she can come out|Reward outside crate|

**Key Principles:**

- Door closing = consequence for breaking position
- Door opening = reward for holding position
- "BREAK" = permission to exit

---

## **WHY SHE STARES AT YOU INSTEAD OF BREAKING**

**What's Actually Happening:**

1. She hears "break"
2. She thinks "Is that a cue? What should I do?"
3. She defaults to holding the behavior (sit, place, etc.) because that's been reinforced
4. She stares at you for more information

**This Is Actually GOOD:**

- ✅ She's engaged with you
- ✅ She's looking for clarity
- ✅ She's defaulting to impulse control (holding position)

**What She Needs:** For "break" to be taught as clearly as "sit" or "place" were taught.

---

## **WHY THE WIRE CRATE WILL HELP**

### **Problem 1: "Break" Isn't Clear**

**Wire crate solution:**

- Clear visibility for threshold manners practice
- You can SEE when she breaks vs. holds position
- Clear feedback loop = faster learning

### **Problem 2: Can't Tell If She's "In Position"**

**Wire crate solution:**

- Perfect visibility through wire
- You know EXACTLY when she's sitting, breaking, or holding
- You can time your "break" cue precisely

---

## **TRAINING TIMELINE**

### **Week 1: Place Bed Foundation**

- **Phase 1:** Place + toss (3 days)
- **Phase 2:** Place + delayed toss (3-5 days)
- **Goal:** She moves off bed when she hears "break"

### **Week 2: No Lure + Generalization**

- **Phase 3:** Place without toss
- **Add:** Meal wait "break"
- **Goal:** "Break" works without luring

### **Week 3: Full Generalization**

- **Add:** Sit "break"
- **Add:** Crate threshold "break" (with new wire crate)
- **Goal:** "Break" is reliable across all behaviors

### **Week 4: Consistency & Duration**

- **Practice:** All contexts
- **Add:** Longer durations before "break"
- **Goal:** Rock-solid release cue

---

## **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If She Doesn't Move When You Say "Break":**

- Go back to Phase 1 (toss the treat)
- Make sure your tone is enthusiastic
- Ensure she's actually "in position" before you release her

### **If She Breaks Before You Say "Break":**

- Don't reward the break
- Reset and try again
- Make the duration shorter (she's not ready for longer holds yet)

### **If She's Confused:**

- Simplify: go back to place bed only
- Increase reward value (better treats)
- Shorten duration (2 seconds instead of 5)

---

## **DAILY PRACTICE INTEGRATION**

### **Where to Practice "Break" Daily:**

|**Context**|**When**|**Reps**|
|---|---|---|
|**Place bed**|During bonus training sessions|10-20|
|**Meal wait**|Both meals (breakfast & dinner)|2|
|**Crate exit**|Every time she exits crate|3-5|
|**Sit practice**|During courtyard session|5-10|

**Total daily reps:** 20-37 (plenty to build the behavior)

---

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **You'll Know "Break" Is Working When:**

✅ She moves immediately when she hears "break"  
✅ She doesn't anticipate - she waits for the cue  
✅ It works across different behaviors (place, sit, crate)  
✅ It works in different locations  
✅ You feel confident releasing her because you can SEE she's in position

---

## **FINAL NOTES**

**You're Not Doing Anything Wrong:** "Break" just needs to be taught systematically like any other behavior. The place bed toss method is the right start - you just need more reps and generalization.

**The Wire Crate Is a Game-Changer:** Clear visibility + solid door = perfect setup for teaching threshold manners and "break" properly.

**Be Patient:** This typically takes 2-4 weeks to fully solidify. That's normal. Progress, not perfection.

---

**START WITH:** Phase 1 on the place bed, 20 reps per session, 2-3 sessions per day.

**MEASURE:** Does she start moving off the bed when she hears "break"?

**PROGRESS:** Once she's reliably moving on the cue, move to Phase 2.
